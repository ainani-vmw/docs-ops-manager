title: Upgrade Preparation Checklist for Pivotal Platform v2.7
owner: Ops Manager
---

This topic serves as a checklist for preparing to upgrade <%= vars.ops_manager %> and <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (PAS) from v2.6 to <%= vars.v_major_version %>.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

This topic contains important preparation steps that you must follow before beginning your upgrade. Failure to follow these instructions may jeopardize your existing deployment data and cause the upgrade to fail.

After completing the steps in this topic, you can continue to [Upgrading <%= vars.ops_manager %>](../install/upgrading-pcf.html).

<%= vars.company_name %> recommends upgrading directly to <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10 from <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.6. To upgrade to <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10, see [Jump Upgrade to <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10](../install/upgrading-pcf.html#jump-upgrade) in _Upgrading <%= vars.platform_name %>_.

<p class='note warning'><strong>Warning:</strong> Although you can skip minor versions when upgrading <%= vars.ops_manager %>, you should not skip minor versions when upgrading PAS. Skipping minor versions when upgrading PAS may result in additional breaking changes. To avoid this, upgrade PAS to <%= vars.v_major_version %>. For more information, see <a href="../install/upgrading-pcf.html#upgrade-tas">Upgrade PAS</a> in <em>Upgrading <%= vars.platform_name %></em>.</p>

<p class='note warning'><strong>Warning:</strong> Any certificate rotation must be completed before upgrading <%= vars.ops_manager %>. Failure to complete the CA rotation results in the inability to **Apply Changes** due to safety violations.</p>

## <a id="back-up-your-pcf-deployment"></a> Back Up Your <%= vars.platform_code %> Deployment

<%= vars.company_name %> recommends backing up your <%= vars.platform_old %> (<%= vars.platform_code %>) deployment before upgrading, to restore in the case of failure. To do this, follow the procedure in [Backing Up Deployments with BBR](../install/backup-restore/backup-pcf-bbr.html).


## <a id='decryption-passphrase'></a> Find Your Decryption Passphrase for <%= vars.ops_manager %>

To complete the <%= vars.ops_manager %> upgrade, you must have your <%= vars.ops_manager %> decryption passphrase. You defined this decryption passphrase during the initial installation of <%= vars.ops_manager %>.


## <a id="review-runtime-release-notes"></a> Review Changes in <%= vars.ops_manager %> and PAS <%= vars.v_major_version %>

Review each of the following links to understand the changes in the new release, such as new features, known issues, and breaking changes.

## <a id="restage-windows-apps"></a> Restage Windows Apps

The `windows2016` stack is deprecated in <%= vars.windows_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %>) <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

Before upgrading to <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> from <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> v2.6, all Windows apps that were pushed with the `windows2016` stack must be restaged to use the `windows` stack.

For more information, see [Deprecation of the windows2016 Stack](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/pcf-release-notes/windows-rn.html#windows2016) in _<%= vars.windows_runtime_full %> v2.6 Release Notes_.

If you are running <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> v2.4.4 or later on <%= vars.platform_code %> v2.6, you can also restage your apps before upgrading to <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> v2.6. For more information about upgrading to <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> v2.6, see [Upgrade to <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> v2.6](#upgrade-pasw) below.


## <a id="tiles-addons"></a> Update Tiles and Add-Ons

These sections describe changes you must make to your product tiles and add-ons before upgrading to <%= vars.platform_name %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

### <a id="upgrade-pasw"></a> Upgrade to <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> v2.6

If you are running <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> v2.4.4 or later on <%= vars.platform_code %> v2.6 and want to upgrade to <%= vars.platform_name %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>, you must upgrade to <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> v2.6 before upgrading to <%= vars.platform_name %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>. To download <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %>, go to the [<%= vars.windows_runtime_full %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pas-windows) page on Pivotal Network.

### <a id="upgrade-stemcell"></a> Upgrade Stemcell to v2019.4 or Later for <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> v2.6

If you are running <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> v2.6 using Windows stemcell v2019.3, you must upgrade your stemcell to v2019.4 or later before you upgrade to Ops Manager <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

To upgrade your stemcell, go to the [Pivotal Stemcells (Windows)](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-windows-server) page on Pivotal Network.

### <a id="update-SCS-2"></a> Upgrade to SCS v2.1 or Remove SCS v2.0

Pivotal Spring Cloud Services (SCS) v2.0.x is not compatible with <%= vars.platform_name %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>. You cannot upgrade to Ops Manager <%= vars.v_major_version %> or PAS <%= vars.v_major_version %> without either removing SCS v2.0.x or upgrading from SCS v2.0.x to SCS v2.1.x first.

If you need to use the `p-circuit-breaker-dashboard` service in SCS v2.0.x, you must upgrade SCS v2.0.x to SCS v2.1.x before you upgrade to <%= vars.platform_name %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

If you are running SCS v3.0.x or SCS v3.1.x alongside SCS v2.0.x and do not require `p-circuit-breaker-dashboard` functionality, you can remove SCS v2.0.x entirely after migrating completely to SCS v3.1.x. To do this, see [How to Upgrade to SCS v3.1.x](https://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/3-1/product-upgrades.html#upgrade-to-3-1) in _Upgrading Pivotal Spring Cloud Services_ in the SCS documentation.

After you successfully remove SCS v2.0.x or upgrade to SCS v2.1.x, you can proceed with the <%= vars.platform_name %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> upgrade.

### <a id="compatibility"></a> Review Service Tile Compatibility

Before you upgrade, check whether the service tiles that you currently have are compatible with the new version of <%= vars.ops_manager %>.

To check <%= vars.platform_name %> versions supported by a service tile, either from Pivotal or a Pivotal partner:

1. Navigate to the tile's download page on [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io).

1. Select the tile version in the **Releases** dropdown.

1. See the **Depends On** section under **Release Details**. For more information, see the tile's release notes.

If the currently-deployed version of a tile is not compatible with <%= vars.platform_name %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>, you must upgrade the tile to a compatible version before you upgrade to <%= vars.platform_name %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>. You do not need to upgrade tiles that are compatible with both <%= vars.platform_code %> v2.6 and <%= vars.platform_name %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

Some partner service tiles may be incompatible with <%= vars.ops_manager %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>.
For information about partner service tile compatibility,
review the **Depends On** section on your partner tile download page, see the tile release documentation in the [VMware Tanzu documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io), or contact the partner organization that produces the service tile.

#### <a id="env"></a> Environment Details

|        | ... |        |        |        |        |

### <a id="upgrade-service-tiles"></a> Upgrade Services Tiles

Upgrade all service tiles to versions that are compatible with <%= vars.ops_manager %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>. Service tiles are add-on products you install alongside your runtime. For example, VMware Tanzu SQL [MySQL for VMs], Healthwatch, and RabbitMQ for VMware Tanzu [VMs] are service tiles.

Do not upgrade runtime tiles, such as PAS, <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %>, or <%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>) at this time.

To check version compatibility, see the [Compatibility Matrix](http://docs.pivotal.io/resources/product-compatibility-matrix.pdf) and service tile documentation.

### <a id='bosh-director'></a> Configure BOSH Director

With each release of a new <%= vars.ops_manager %> version, BOSH Director may require specific updates before upgrading to the new version. For actions to take before upgrading to <%= vars.ops_manager %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>, see the sections below.

#### <a id="check-specs"></a> Check Required Machine Specifications

Check the required machine specifications for <%= vars.ops_manager %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>. These specifications are specific to your IaaS. If these specifications do not match your existing <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment, modify the values of your <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM instance. For example, if the boot disk of your existing <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment is 50&nbsp;GB and the new <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment requires 100&nbsp;GB, increase the size of your <%= vars.ops_manager %> boot disk to 100&nbsp;GB.

### <a id='patch'></a> Configure PAS

With each release of a new <%= vars.ops_manager %> version, PAS may require specific updates before upgrading to the new version. See the following sections for what action to take before upgrading to <%= vars.ops_manager %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>:

#### <a id="disable-unused-errands"></a> (Optional) Disable Unused Errands

To save upgrade time, you can disable unused PAS post-deploy errands. For more information, see [Post-Deploy Errands](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/2-8/tile-errands.html#post-deploy) in _Errands_. Only disable these errands if your environment does not need them.

In some cases, if you have previously disabled lifecycle errands for any installed product to reduce deployment time, you may want to re-enable these errands before upgrading. For more information, see [Adding and Deleting Products](../install/add-delete.html#add-import) in _Adding and Deleting Products_.

#### <a id="groot-gc"></a> Configure Diego Cell Garbage Collection

In the **App Containers** pane of the PAS tile, if **Docker images disk cleanup scheduling on Diego Cell VMs** is set to **Clean up disk space once usage fills disk** and the value of **Reserved disk space for other jobs** is different from the default of `15360`, you must specify a new threshold.

If the scheduling is set to **Never clean up Diego Cell disk space** or **Routinely clean up Diego Cell disk space**, or the reserved disk space value is set to the default of `15360`, no action is necessary. All thresholds will migrate to a sensible value when you upgrade PAS. For more information, see [Options for Disk Cleanup](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-7/operating/config-cell-cleanup.html#options) in _Configuring Diego Cell Disk Cleanup Scheduling_ in the PAS documentation.

#### <a id="syslog-agents"></a> Do Not Edit Syslog Agent Configuration When Upgrading from PAS <%= vars.v_major_version %>.6 or Earlier

If you are upgrading from PAS <%= vars.v_major_version %>.6 or earlier, do not change your Syslog Agent configuration when you stage PAS <%= vars.v_major_version %>.7 or later for the first time. For example, if Syslog Agents are enabled on your current version of PAS, ensure that Syslog Agents are enabled when you stage PAS <%= vars.v_major_version %>.7 or later for the first time.

If you change your Syslog Agent configuration after staging and before the first deploy of PAS <%= vars.v_major_version %>.7 or later, there is a significant period of log loss or log duplication while BOSH enables or disables Syslog Agents. For more information about this log loss or duplication, see [Duplicate or Missing Logs](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-7/release-notes/runtime-rn.html#duplicate-logs) in _<%= vars.app_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> Release Notes_ in the PAS documentation.

You can edit the Syslog Agent configuration in PAS <%= vars.v_major_version %>.7
or later after the first deploy. To edit your Syslog Agent configuration, see
[Configure System Logging](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-7/operating/configure-pas.html#sys-logging)
in _Configuring PAS_ in the PAS documentation.

### <a id="stemcell-compat"></a> Check OS Compatibility of BOSH-Managed Add-Ons and Tiles

Before upgrading to <%= vars.platform_name %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>, operators who have deployed any <%= vars.platform_code %> add-ons such as **IPsec for <%= vars.platform_code %>**, **ClamAV for <%= vars.platform_code %>**, or **File Integrity Monitoring for <%= vars.platform_code %>** and who have deployed or are planning to deploy <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> must modify the add-on manifest to specify a compatible OS stemcell. For more information, see the [<%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-7/windows/index.html).

For example, **File Integrity Monitor for <%= vars.platform_code %>** (FIM) is not supported on Windows. Therefore, the manifest must use an `include` directive to specify the target OS stemcell of `ubuntu-trusty` and `ubuntu-xenial`.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To upgrade to a Xenial stemcell, see the documentation for each add-on and follow the instructions.</p>

To update an add-on manifest:

1. Locate your existing add-on manifest file. For example, for FIM, locate the `fim.yml` you uploaded to the Ops Manager VM.

1. Modify the manifest to include following `include` directive to your manifest:

    ```
      include:
        stemcell:
          - os: ubuntu-xenial
    ```

1. Upload the modified manifest file to your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment. For example instructions, see [Installing File Integrity Monitoring on BOSH Director](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-fim/2-0/installing-bosh.html) in the File Integrity Monitoring documentation.

If you use any other BOSH-managed add-ons in your deployment, you should verify OS compatibility for those component as well. For more information about configuring BOSH add-on manifests, see [Addons Block](https://bosh.io/docs/runtime-config.html#addons) in _Director Runtime Config_ in the BOSH documentation.

### <a id="azure-blobstore-addon"></a> Check Backup and Restore External Blobstore Add-On

If you have enabled external blobstore backups for an Azure Blobstore using the blobstore add-on, you must update your runtime configuration to remove the `sdk-preview` add-on before upgrading. If you do not remove this job, upgrading PAS fails with the error below:

```
Preparing deployment: Preparing deployment (00:00:01)
  L Error: Colocated job 'azure-blobstore-backup-restorer' is already added to the instance group 'backup-restore'.
```

After removing this job from your runtime configuration, ensure that the **Enable backup and restore** checkbox is enabled in the **File Storage** pane of the PAS tile.

For more information, see [Azure Blobstores](../install/backup-restore/enabling-external-blobstore-backups.html#azure) in _Enabling External Blobstore Backups_.


## <a id="cert-expiry"></a> Check Certificate Authority Expiration Dates

Depending on the requirements of your deployment, you may need to rotate your certificate authority (CA) certificates. The non-configurable certificates in your deployment expire every two years. You must regenerate and rotate them so that critical components do not face a complete outage.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <%= vars.ops_manager %> uses SHA-2 certificates and hashes by default. You can convert existing SHA-1 hashes into SHA-2 hashes by rotating your <%= vars.ops_manager %> certificates using the procedure described in <a href="../security/pcf-infrastructure/rotate-saml-ca.html">Rotating Identity Provider SAML Certificates</a>.</p>

To retrieve information about all the RSA and CA certificates for the BOSH Director and other products in your deployment, you can use the `GET /api/v0/deployed/certificates?expires_within=TIME` request of the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API.

In this request, the `expires_within` parameter is optional. Valid values for the parameter are `d` for days, `w` for weeks, `m` for months, and `y` for years. For example, to search for certificates expiring within one month, replace `TIME` with `1m`:

```
curl "https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/certificates?expires_within=1m" \
 -X GET \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"
```

Where:

* `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` is the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment.
* `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is your UAA access token.

For information about regenerating and rotating CA certificates, see [Overview of Certificate Rotation](../security/pcf-infrastructure/api-cert-rotation.html).


## <a id="capacity"></a> Check the Capacity of Your Deployment

These sections describe steps for ensuring your deployment has adequate capacity to perform the upgrade.

### <a id="confirm-om-disk"></a> Confirm Adequate Disk Space

<%= partial 'check_disk_before_upgrade' %>

### <a id="check-diego-cell-ram-and-disk"></a> Check Diego Cell RAM and Disk

Check that Diego Cells have sufficient available RAM and disk capacity to support app containers.

The KPIs that monitor these these resources are are:

* `rep.CapacityRemainingMemory`
* `rep.CapacityRemainingDisk`

### <a id="adjust-diego-cell-limits"></a> Adjust Diego Cell Limits

If needed, adjust the maximum number of Diego Cells that the platform can upgrade simultaneously, to avoid overloading the other Diego Cells. For more information, see [Limit Component Instance Restarts](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-7/operating/configuring.html#limit-restart) in _Configuring PAS for Upgrades_ in the PAS documentation.

The maximum number of Diego Cells that can update at once, `max_in_flight`, is 4%. This setting is configured in the BOSH manifest's Diego Cell definition. For more information, see [Prevent Overload](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-7/operating/configuring.html#limitations-considerations) in _Configuring PAS for Upgrades_ in the PAS documentation.

For more information about these KPIs, see [Diego Cell Metrics](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-7/operating/monitoring/kpi.html#Cell) in _Key Performance Indicators_ in the PAS documentation.

### <a id="storage"></a> Review File Storage IOPS and Other Upgrade Limiting Factors

During the <%= vars.ops_manager %> upgrade process, a large quantity of data is moved around on disk.

To ensure a successful upgrade of your deployment, verify that your underlying PAS file storage is performant enough to handle the upgrade. For more information about the configurations to evaluate, see [Configure File Storage](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-7/operating/configuring.html#file-storage) in _Configuring PAS for Upgrades_ in the PAS documentation.

In addition to file storage IOPS, consider additional existing deployment factors that can impact overall upgrade duration and performance:

| **Factor** | **Impact** |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| **Network latency** | Network latency can contribute to how long it takes to move app instance data to new containers. |
| **Number of ASGs** | A large number of App Security Groups (ASGs) in your deployment can contribute to an increase in app instance container startup time. For more information, see [App Security Groups](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-7/concepts/asg.html) in the PAS documentation. |
| **Number of app instances and app growth** | A large increase in the number of app instances and average droplet size since the initial deployment can increase the upgrade impact on your system. |

For example upgrade-related performance measurements of an existing production deployment,
see [Upgrade Load Example: Pivotal Web Services During Upgrade](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-7/operating/pws_upgrade_load.html) in the PAS documentation.

### <a id="bosh-clean-up"></a> Run BOSH Clean-Up

To clean up old stemcells, releases, orphaned disks, and other resources before upgrade:

1. Run:

	```
	bosh -e ALIAS clean-up --all
	```
	Where `ALIAS` is your BOSH deployment alias.

This cleanup helps prevent the product and stemcell upload process from exceeding the BOSH Director's available persistent disk space.


## <a id="health"></a> Check the Health of Your Deployment

These sections describe steps for ensuring your deployment is healthy before you perform the upgrade.

### <a id="collect-foundation-health-status"></a> Collect Foundation Health Status

For collecting foundation health status, <%= vars.company_name %> recommends Healthwatch,
which monitors and alerts on the current health, performance,
and capacity of your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment.
For more information, see the [Healthwatch documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/healthwatch/index.html).

If you are not using Pivotal Healthwatch, you can do some or all of the following to collect foundation health status:

* Check your system status.
	* To check the status of your BOSH instances, run:

		```
		bosh -e ALIAS -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME instances --ps
		```
		Where:
		* `ALIAS` is your BOSH deployment alias.
		* `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the name of the BOSH deployment with the instances you want to check.
		<br>
		<br>
		`bosh instances` with the flags `--ps`, `--vitals`, or `--failing` highlights individual job failure.
	* To check the status of your BOSH VMs, run:

		```
		bosh -e ALIAS vms --vitals
		```
		Where `ALIAS` is your BOSH deployment alias.
		<br>
		<br>
		This command reveals VMs with high CPU, high memory, high disk utilization, and with `state` != `running`.
	* To check the status of your BOSH cloud config, run:

		```
		bosh -e ALIAS -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME cck --report
		```
		Where:
		* `ALIAS` is your BOSH deployment alias.
		* `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the name of the BOSH deployment with the cloud config you want to check.

* Check the **Status** tab of each PAS tile for VM CPU, RAM, and disk use levels.

* Check that <%= vars.ops_manager %> persistent disk usage is below 50%. If not, follow the procedure in [Confirm Adequate Disk Space](#confirm-om-disk) above.

* (Optional) Check the logs for errors before proceeding with the upgrade. For more information, see [Viewing Logs in the Command Line Interface](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html#view) in _App Logging in PAS_ in the PAS documentation.

### <a id="push-test-app"></a> Push and Scale a Test App

Check that a test app can be pushed and scaled horizontally, manually, or through automated testing. This check ensures that the platform supports apps as expected before the upgrade.

### <a id="validate-mysql-cluster-health"></a> Validate MySQL Cluster Health

If you are running PAS MySQL as a cluster, run the `mysql-diag` tool to validate health of the cluster.

For BOSH CLI v2 instructions, see [Running mysql-diag](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/mysql/mysql-diag.html) in the PAS documentation.

### <a id="check-health"></a> Review Pending and Recent Changes

To review pending and recent changes:

1. Confirm there are no outstanding changes in Ops Manager or any other tile. All tiles should be green. If necessary, click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes**.

1. After applying changes, click **Recent Install Logs** to confirm that the changes completed cleanly:

    ```
    Cleanup complete
    {"type": "step_finished", "id": "clean_up_bosh.cleaning_up"}
    Exited with 0.
    ```


## <a id="export"></a> Export Your Installation

To export your installation:

1. In the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard, click the account dropdown and select **Settings**.

1. On the **Settings** page, select **Export Installation Settings** from the left menu, then click **Export Installation Settings**.

This exports the current <%= vars.platform_code %> installation with all of its assets.

When you export an installation, the export contains the base VM images, necessary packages, and configuration settings, but does not include releases between upgrades if <%= vars.ops_manager %> has already uploaded them to BOSH. When backing up your deployment, you must take this into account by backing up the BOSH blobstore that contains the uploaded releases. BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR) backs up the BOSH blobstore. For more information, see [Backing Up Deployments with BBR](../install/backup-restore/backup-pcf-bbr.html).

* The export time depends on the size of the exported file.

* Some browsers do not provide feedback on the status of the export process and might appear to hang.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Some operating systems automatically unzip the exported installation. If this occurs, create a ZIP file of the unzipped export. Do not start compressing at the "installation" folder level. Instead, start compressing at the level containing the <code>rails_database_dump.postgres</code> file.


## <a id="next-steps"></a> Next Steps

Now that you have completed the Upgrade Preparation Checklist, continue to [Upgrading <%= vars.ops_manager %>](../install/upgrading-pcf.html).
