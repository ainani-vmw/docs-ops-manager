This topic describes key features of the Pivotal Operations Manager interface that is used
to manage [<%= vars.platform_name %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf).

## <a id="installation-dashboard"></a> Installation Dashboard Page

The Installation Dashboard is the central Ops Manager interface for managing your <%= vars.platform_name %>
deployment. It displays the BOSH Director configuration for your IaaS and product tiles
for your <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment.

The following screenshot shows the Installation Dashboard. Each section is labeled with a
red letter. Click the image to see it at full size.

<%# Screenshot written in Omnigraffle. Edit in ./images/omnigraffle/interface.graffle %>
<a target="_blank" href="images/interface.png"><%= image_tag("interface.png", :alt =>
							     "Screenshot of the Ops
							     Manager Installation
							     Dashboard. For a description
							     of each labeled section, see
							     the list below") %></a>

The following list describes each labeled section of the Installation Dashboard:

- **A**---**Import a Product**: Click this button to add a new product to Ops Manager. You
can download <%= vars.ops_manager %>-compatible product files from
[VMware Tanzu Network](https://network.pivotal.io).
  * If you have configured a [VMware Tanzu Network
API](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.','-') %>/customizing/add-delete.html) token in the **Settings** section of Ops Manager, a
list of the latest versions of already imported products appears automatically.

- **B**---**Delete All Unused Products**: Click this link to delete any unused products.

- **C**---**Installation Dashboard**: Click this link to return to the **Installation
Dashboard** page from other Ops Manager pages.

- **D**---**Stemcell Library**: Click this link to open the **Stemcell Library**. In the
**Stemcell Library** you can import stemcells, stage stemcells, and review your stemcell
version numbers. For more information, see [Importing and Managing
Stemcells](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/opsguide/managing-stemcells.html).

- **E**---**Change Log**: Click this link to view and search a log of your previous
installations. For more information, see [Change Log Page](#changelog) below.

- **F**---**User Account Menu**: Click the arrow next to your username to view the menu.
Use this menu to navigate to your **Settings** page, view **My Account** to change your
email and password, or log out of the **Installation Dashboard**. For details about account
information, see [My Account](#account_settings) below. For more information about available
Ops Manager settings, see [Settings Page](#settings) below.

- **G**---**Revert**: Click the revert button to return to the previous successful
installation. Any pending changes you have made to the current installation settings will
be lost.

- **H**---**Review Pending Changes**: Click the button to go to the **Review Pending
Changes** page, which organizes pending changes by tile. You are able to enable or disable
each tile to selectively deploy individual tiles and their dependencies. For more
information, see [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](../install/review-pending-changes.html).

- **I**---**Orange Bar**: Indicates that additional configuration for the product tile is
required before deployment. Click the product tile to complete its configuration.

- **J**---**Missing Stemcell Link**: If an imported product is missing a required
stemcell, a **Missing Stemcell** link appears on the tile. Click this link to open the
Stemcell Library. For more information, see [Importing and Managing
Stemcells](../opsguide/managing-stemcells.html).

- **K**---**API Docs**: Click this link to go to the Ops Manager API documentation, which
details how you can manage Ops Manager through the API rather than with the user
interface. For more information about the Ops Manager API, see [Using the Ops Manager
API](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.','-') %>/customizing/ops-man-api.html).


## <a id="changelog"></a> Change Log Page

Navigate to the **Change Log** page by clicking the corresponding link in the dashboard
header.
This page shows Ops Manager's deployment history, a record of all of its **Apply Changes** actions.

The table lists the following top-level attributes for each deployment:

<table id='TK-NAME' border="1" class="nice" >
  <tr>
    <th>Label</th>
    <th>Type</th>

    <td>Text</td>
    <td>A sequentially-numbered identifier for the deployment</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <th>USER</th>
    <td>Username</td>
    <td>The user who initiated the deployment</td>
  </tr>
</table>

A **LOGS** button for each deployment opens the deployment's full Installation Log.

Within each deployment listing, a table details for the individual products deployed in or deleted from each installation.

The details listed for each product are as follows:

<table id='TK-NAME' border="1" class="nice" >
  <tr>
    <th>Label</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr><tr>
    <th>PRODUCT</th>
    <td>Text</td>
    <td>The name of the product</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <th>ACTION</th>
    <td>One of the following labels: <strong>ADDED</strong>, <strong>UPDATED</strong>, <strong>DELETED</strong>, <strong>NO CHANGES</strong>, <strong>FAILED</strong></td>
    <td>The action, if any, that the deployment took with the product</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <th>STARTED</th>
    <td>UTC timestamp</td>
    <td>When Ops Manager began deploying the product</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <th>FINISHED</th>
    <td>UTC timestamp</td>

  </tr><tr>
    <th>DURATION</th>
    <td>Time, in minutes</td>

</table>

A **Total** row, below the individual product rows, lists all-product totals for the **STARTED**, **FINISHED**, AND **DURATION** fields.

The following section describes each configuration pane:

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Modifying these settings does not require you to

settings apply to the Ops Manager VM. The BOSH Director does not apply them to your <%= vars.platform_name %>
deployment.</p>

### Change Decryption Passphrase

<%= image_tag("settings-ssl-cert.png", :alt => "The 'Settings' page shows the 'SSL
      Certificate' pane highlighted on the left-hand tabular layout to indicate selection. The body shows a header titled 'SSL Certificate' with an option to 'Revert to self-signed certificate' followed by help text and two required fields: 'Certificate' and 'Private key'.

If you leave the fields blank, Ops Manager uses an auto-generated self-signed certificate rather than your own custom certificate and private key. If you wish to replace a custom certificate with a self-signed certificate, select **Revert to self-signed certificate**.

  <%= image_tag("settings-pivotal-network.png", :alt => "The 'Settings' page shows the
          'Pivotal Network Settings' pane highlighted on the left-hand tabular layout to

### <a id="vmware-tanzu"></a>VMware Tanzu Network Settings

Enter your [VMware Tanzu Network
API](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.','-') %>/customizing/add-delete.html#pivnet-api) token and click **Add Token** to connect your **Installation Dashboard** to VMware Tanzu Network.

### Proxy Settings
If you are using a proxy to connect to Ops Manager, update your
**Proxy Settings** by providing a **HTTP proxy**, **HTTPS proxy**, or **No proxy**.

  <%= image_tag("banner-ui.png", :alt => "Below, the Settings page

### Syslog
Viewable by administrators only. Configure a custom Syslog server for Ops
Manager. When you select **Yes** and fill the following fields, Ops Manager produces and
sends all syslog entries from the Ops Manager VM to the configured syslog endpoint. Ops Manager also sends BOSH Director
access events to the syslog endpoint.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Ops Manager syslog entries are sent in RFC 3164 format.</p>

To configure a custom syslog endpoint for Ops Manager logs:

<%= partial(:"/pcf/ops-manager/syslog_bosh", :locals => { :syslog_context => 'Ops Manager' }) %>
