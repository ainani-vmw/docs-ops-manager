## <a id='certificates'></a> Certificates page

Go to the **Certificates** topic by clicking the corresponding link in the dashboard header. This topic shows the certificates in your <%= vars.ops_manager %> installation.

### In <%= vars.ops_manager %> 3.0.28 and higher

<%= vars.ops_manager %> 3.0.28 updates the **Certificates** page. Leaf certificates are now nested under the CA certificate that signs them, certificates are listed only once instead of per deployment, and a rotation status is listed for each certificate.

![The Certificates page shows information in the following columns: Certificate name, Deployments, Propagation, Rotation Status, Expiration Date, Rotation Procedure, Location, Configurable, and Auto Rotation.](images/certificates-3.0.28.png)

The following describes the information listed on the **Certificates** page:

+ **Type:** a certificate authority (CA) or leaf certificate.

+ **Certificate name:** the name of the certificate.

+ **Deployments:** the number of deployments that use the certificate. This links to a page listing the deployments associated with the certificate and whether they've been deployed or not.

+ **Propagation:** the propagation progress of a certificate after it has been regenerated. The first number is how many deployments are using the updated version of the certificate. The second number is the total number of deployments associated with the certificate. For instance, "1 of 5" would indicate that only 1 deployment is using the new certificate out of 5 deployments total.

+ **Rotation Status:** the next step necessary to rotate the certificate. See [Rotation Status definitions](#rotation-status-definitions).

+ **Expiration Date:** the date that the certificate expires.

+ **Rotation Procedure:** a link to documentation about how to rotate the certificate.

+ **Location:** whether CredHub or <%= vars.ops_manager %> stores and manages the certificate.

+ **Configurable:** whether or not you can configure the certificate. If a certificate is configurable, you can generate your own and paste it into <%= vars.ops_manager %> configuration panes.

+ **Auto Rotation:** whether the certificate is automatically rotated by <%= vars.ops_manager %>. Rotation of these certificates are advanced during Apply Changes without the need to make API calls to rotate them. For more information, see [Automatic rotation of BOSH DNS certificates](security/pcf-infrastructure/automatic-rotation-bosh-dns.html).

#### <a id='rotation-status-definitions'></a> Rotation Status definitions

The **Rotation Status** column indicates what is the next action needed to rotate a certificate. The potential rotation statuses include:

+ **Needs propagation:** New versions of the certificate are available and need to be deployed. To deploy the certificate, initiate an Apply Changes on all tiles associated with the certificate, selecting the "Upgrade all service instances" errand for any that are service tiles. For any non-tile deployments associated with the certificate, use `bosh deploy`. For auto-rotated certificates, a stemcell upgrade is required to complete propagation of the new certificate versions.

+ **Ready to regenerate CA:** The CA certificate is ready to be regenerated with the recommended procedure.

+ **Ready to activate new CA:** The new version of the CA certificate is ready to be activated with the recommended procedure.

+ **Ready to regenerate leaf:** For CA certificates, the certificate is ready to regenerate all its child certificates to be signed by the new CA. For leaf certificates, the certificate is ready to be regenerated.

+ **Ready to regenerate configurable leaf:** The certificate is ready to either be regenerated using its CA, or ready to be updated with a new external certificate. When using an externally created certificate, ensure that the certificate which signs the configurable leaf is trusted. For example, the leaf certificate is signed by a globally trusted CA, or the signing CA is added in the BOSH Director tile > Security tab > Trusted Certificates field.

+ **Ready to delete old CA:** The new CA certificate and its leafs have been deployed, and the certificate is ready to delete the old version.

+ **Rotate parent CA:** The signing CA certificate is expiring soon. Rather than rotate the current certificate directly, you should rotate its CA certificate. Rotating the CA certificate will rotate the current certificate as part of its rotation procedure.

+ **Unknown state - contact support:** <%= vars.ops_manager %> is unable to determine the next step of the rotation. This can mean that the certificate is in a state that will generate safety violations when rotated. Contacting support and including a support bundle, which contains information such as the output of `maestro topology`, is the best course of action.

#### Certificate propagation status page

Each certificate on the **Certificates** page contains a link in the **Deployments** column that leads to a propagation status page for that certificate. This page lists information about which tiles and deployments need to be redeployed to distribute new versions of the certificate.

Individual BOSH deployments (such as service instances or TKGI clusters) are nested under the tile that creates those deployments. BOSH deployments that are created outside of <%= vars.ops_manager %> are nested under 'Non-Tile Deployments'.

![The Certificates propagation page shows information in the following columns: Deployment, and Propagation Status.](images/certificate-propagation-status.png)

The following describes the information listed on the page:

+ **Deployment:** The name of the BOSH deployment that uses the certificate.

+ **Propagation Status:** The status of the latest version of the certificate for the corresponding deployment. "Incomplete" means that the deployment needs to be redeployed to propagate new versions of the certificate. "Complete" means that the deployment uses the latest version of the certificate, and that no action is required.

### In <%= vars.ops_manager %> 3.0.27 and lower

The following image shows the top section of the **Certificates** page:

![The Certificates page shows information in the following columns: Certificate name, Tile Name, Location, Type, Configurable, Expiration Date, and Rotation Procedure.](images/certificates.png)

The **Certificates** page includes the certificates that the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API attempts to rotate. This includes both certificates that the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API can rotate and certificates that you must rotate manually.

For information about how to rotate these certificates, see [Overview of Certificate Rotation](security/pcf-infrastructure/api-cert-rotation.html).

The following describes the information listed on the **Certificates** page:

+ **Certificate name:** the name of the certificate.

+ **Tile Name:** the product name with its unique identifier.

+ **Location:** whether CredHub or <%= vars.ops_manager %> stores and manages the certificate.

+ **Type:** a certificate authority (CA) or leaf certificate.

+ **Configurable:** whether or not you can configure the certificate. If a certificate is configurable, you can generate your own and paste it into <%= vars.ops_manager %> configuration panes.

+ **Expiration Date:** the date that the certificate expires.

+ **Rotation Procedure:** a link to documentation about how to rotate the certificate.
