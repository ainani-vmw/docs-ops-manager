You can use AD FS as your SAML IDP for Ops Manager and Pivotal Application Service (PAS).

* To use AD FS as your SAML IDP for Ops Manager, follow these procedures:
  * [Configure SAML Integration in Ops Manager](#ops-man)
  * [Configure SAML Integration in AD FS](#adfs)

* To use AD FS as your SAML IDP for PAS, follow these procedures:
  * [Configure SAML Integration in PAS](#pas)
  * [Configure SAML Integration in AD FS](#adfs)

### <a id='ops-man'></a> Configure SAML Integration in Ops Manager

To configure Ops Manager to use AD FS as your SAML IDP:

1. Download your IDP metadata from `https://AD-FS-HOSTNAME/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml`, where `AD-FS-HOSTNAME` is the hostname of your AD FS deployment.

1. Follow the procedure in _Use an Identity Provider_ in the BOSH Director configuration topic for your IaaS:
  * [Configuring BOSH Director on AWS](../aws/config-manual.html#idp)
