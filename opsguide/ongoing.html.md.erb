This topic describes how to perform routine operations on a running Ops Manager.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Ongoing operations are procedures that Ops Manager operators routinely perform to keep the platform working as it should, or to change how it works if the platform needs to do something new or has a problem.

Examples include:

* Performing Ops Manager upgrades
* Making changes to your IaaS and external components
* Monitoring platform health, checking logs, and generating usage reports
* Tuning the platform to eliminate bottlenecks or increase capacity
* Giving developers access to new software services, stacks, and app capabilities
* Backing up and restoring the platform

In addition to these tasks, Ops Manager operators also routinely perform Day 2 configurations to configure or change platform features and integrations even well past Day 2. For more information, see [Day 2 Configurations](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-7/operating/day2.html).
