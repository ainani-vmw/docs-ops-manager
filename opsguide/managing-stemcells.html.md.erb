This topic explains how to use the Stemcell Library in <%= vars.ops_manager_first %> to import and stage stemcells to products.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

The Stemcell Library imports and stages stemcells to products.

For more conceptual information about floating stemcells and stemcell upgrades, see [Floating Stemcells](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/customizing/understanding-stemcells.html).

<p class='note warning'><strong>Warning:</strong> Some product releases require Xenial stemcells, as listed in <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/stemcells/xenial-tiles.html">Tiles Using Xenial Stemcells in <%= vars.ops_manager %></a>. If you are importing and using Xenial stemcells for the first time, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/pcf-release-notes/breaking-changes.html#xenial">Updates for Xenial Stemcell Support</a>.</p>


## <a id='import'></a> Import and Stage a Stemcell

To import and stage a stemcell:

1. Download the appropriate `.tgz` stemcell file from [VMware Tanzu Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf).
	<p class='note'>
		<strong>Note:</strong>
		<%= vars.ops_manager %> does not support heavy or full stemcells for the AWS and GCP IaaSes.
		For these IaaSes, you must use a light stemcell.
		For more information about light stemcells, see <a href="https://bosh.io/docs/build-stemcell/#light-stemcells">Light Stemcells</a> in the BOSH documentation.
	</p>

1. Click **Import Stemcell** to permanently import a stemcell into <%= vars.ops_manager %>. The **IMPORT STEMCELL** dialog box appears.
2. Select the products you want to stage.

 1. Click **APPLY STEMCELL TO PRODUCTS**.

 2. Click **Dismiss** to close the dialog box.


## <a id='version'></a> Choose a Stemcell Version

If you have uploaded multiple versions of a stemcell, you can use the dropdown in the **Staged** column to choose which version to use.

You can choose a different version until you deploy. After deployment, older stemcell versions are no longer available. If you want to use a stemcell that you uploaded before upgrading, you must re-upload it after upgrading <%= vars.ops_manager %>.

![The dropdown for a stemcell is displayed in the Staged column. In this example, three versions are available.](images/opsman-view-available-stemcells.png)

If the stemcell is displayed with a green checkmark and the words **Latest stemcell** below the **Staged** dropdown, the stemcell is the latest available version on your host. An outdated stemcell displays **Stemcell out-of-date**.
