This topic shows you how to use the Stemcell Library in <%= vars.ops_manager_first %> to import and stage stemcells to products.
For conceptual information about floating stemcells and stemcell upgrades,
see [Floating Stemcells](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/2.10/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/install-understanding-stemcells.html).

Some product releases require Xenial stemcells, as listed
in <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/2.10/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/opsguide-managing-stemcells.html">Tiles Using Xenial Stemcells in <%= vars.ops_manager %></a>.
If you are importing and using Xenial stemcells for the first time, see <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/2.10/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/release-notes.html#xenial">Updates for Xenial Stemcell Support</a>.

## <a id='import'></a> Import and stage a stemcell

To import and stage a stemcell:

1. Download the appropriate `.tgz` stemcell file from [VMware Tanzu Network](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/stemcells-ubuntu-xenial/).

    <%= vars.ops_manager %> does not support heavy or full stemcells for GCP.
    For GCP, you must use a light stemcell.
    For more information about light stemcells, see <a href="https://bosh.io/docs/build-stemcell/#light-stemcells">Light Stemcells</a> in the BOSH documentation.

1. Click **Import Stemcell** to permanently import a stemcell into <%= vars.ops_manager %>. The **IMPORT STEMCELL** dialog box appears.

1. Select the products you want to stage.

1. Click **APPLY STEMCELL TO PRODUCTS**, or click **Dismiss** to close the pane.


## <a id='version'></a> Choose a stemcell version

If you have uploaded multiple versions of a stemcell, you can use the drop-down menu in the **Staged** column to choose which version to use.

![The drop-down menu for a stemcell is displayed in the Staged column. In this example, three versions are available.](images/opsman-view-available-stemcells.png)

If the stemcell is displayed with a green checkmark and the words **Latest stemcell** below the **Staged** drop-down menu, the stemcell is the latest available version on your host. An outdated stemcell displays **Stemcell out-of-date**.

When you upgrade <%= vars.ops_manager %>, any older stemcell versions that were not in use by a product are removed from the Stemcell Library. If a stemcell was in use by a product prior to upgrading, it will continue to be available after the upgrade. If you want to use a stemcell that was removed as part of the upgrade, you must upload it again.
