## <a id='how-to-upgrade'></a> How to Upgrade

To upgrade to <%= vars.ops_manager_full %> v3.0, see [Upgrading <%= vars.ops_manager %>](install/upgrading-pcf.html).


## <a id='major-features'></a> New Features in <%= vars.ops_manager %> v3.0

<%= vars.ops_manager %> v3.0 includes the following major features:

### <a id='ubuntu-jammy'></a> Jammy Jellyfish Stemcell Support

<%= vars.ops_manager %> v3.0 uses Jammy Jellyfish, a Jammy stemcell based on Ubuntu 22.04.

The previously-supported Xenial Xerus stemcells were based on Ubuntu 16.04. These stemcells are due to reach end of general support (EOGS) and stop receiving
security updates in April 2024. You can still use Xenial stemcells in conjunction with tiles installed on <%= vars.ops_manager %> v3.0 until they reach EOGS.

<%= vars.ops_manager %> v3.0 allows tile authors to upgrade from Xenial stemcells to Jammy Jellyfish stemcells. This ensures that <%= vars.ops_manager %> v3.0
users can maintain access to secure stemcells.

### <a id='applied-runtime-config'></a> Changes Page Includes Applied Runtime Configs

The **Review Pending Changes** page for a tile includes a list of runtime configurations to be applied to that tile.

Tiles can use runtime configurations to influence the behavior of VMs that other tiles deploy. For example, when you activate the **Enable additional System
Metrics** checkbox in the **Director Config** pane of the BOSH Director tile, the BOSH Director applies a runtime configuration to the VMs that
<%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) deploys that allows the BOSH Director to collect detailed metrics from
<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> VMs.

Changes to a runtime configuration can cause longer deployment times when you re-deploy a tile. By reviewing the runtime configurations that are to be applied
to tiles during re-deployment, you can determine in advance which tiles may take a longer time to re-deploy.

### <a id='aws-vm-catalog'></a> AWS Deployments Use 5th-Generation AMD Instances

<%= vars.ops_manager %> v3.0 uses 5th-generation AMD instances for AWS deployments. 5th-generation AMD instances are more performant and cost-effective than
previous instance types. Both Jammy Jellyfish stemcells and Xenial stemcells support 5th-generation AMD instances.

New installations of <%= vars.ops_manager %> v3.0 use 5th-generation AMD instances by default. If you upgrade to <%= vars.ops_manager %> v3.0 from
<%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10 or earlier, you can either keep your current VM types or convert your VMs to 5th-generation AMD instances in the **AWS Config**
pane of the BOSH Director tile. For more information, see [Step 2: AWS Config Page](aws/config-manual.html#pcfaws-om-awsconfig) in _Configuring BOSH Director
on AWS_.

If you are using a custom instance type catalog, the VM types that you can use do not change.

For more information about AWS Linux instance types, see the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html). For
more information about AWS Windows instance types, see the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/instance-types.html).

### <a id='aws-gp3'></a> AWS Deployments Use GP3 Disks

<%= vars.ops_manager %> v3.0 uses gp3 disks for AWS deployments. gp3 disks are more performant and cost-effective than gp2 disks.

New installations of <%= vars.ops_manager %> v3.0 use gp3 disks by default. If you upgrade to <%= vars.ops_manager %> v3.0 from <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10
or earlier, you can either keep your current disk types or convert your disks to gp3 in the **AWS Config** pane of the BOSH Director tile. For more
information, see [Step 2: AWS Config Page](aws/config-manual.html#pcfaws-om-awsconfig) in _Configuring BOSH Director on AWS_.

### <a id='google-vm-catalog'></a> GCP Deployments Use E2 Series Instances

<%= vars.ops_manager %> v3.0 uses E2 Series instances for GCP deployments. E2 Series instances are more performant and cost-effective than previous instance
types. Both Jammy Jellyfish stemcells and Xenial stemcells support 5th-generation AMD instances.

New installations of <%= vars.ops_manager %> v3.0 use E2 Series instances by default. If you upgrade to <%= vars.ops_manager %> v3.0 from
<%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10 or earlier, you can either keep your current VM types or convert your VMs to E2 Series instances in the **Google Config** pane
of the BOSH Director tile. For more information, see [Step 2: Configure GCP Tile](gcp/config-manual.html#gcp-config) in _Configuring BOSH Director on GCP_.

If you are using a custom instance type catalog, the VM types that you can use do not change.

For more information about GCP instance types, see the [GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types).

### <a id='google-native-machine-types'></a> GCP Deployments Allow Machine Types in Custom VM Type Catalogs

<%= vars.ops_manager %> v3.0 allows you to include machine types in your custom VM type catalogs for GCP deployments. When you configure VMs to use a specific
machine type as their VM type, the BOSH Director creates VMs using that machine type, rather than creating a custom VM that matches the CPU and RAM
specifications. This allows you to use specialized VM types that are not in the default <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM type catalog.

If you do not specify a machine type as a custom VM type, the BOSH Director continues to create VMs that match the CPU and RAM specifications.

For more information, see the [<%= vars.ops_manager %> API
documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/3-0/opsman-api/#tag/VM-types/paths/~1api~1v0~1vm_types/put).


## <a id='breaking-changes'></a> Breaking Changes in <%= vars.ops_manager %> v3.0

<%= vars.ops_manager %> v3.0 includes the following breaking changes:

### <a id='bosh-metrics-server-removed'></a> BOSH System Metrics Server is Removed

The BOSH System Metrics Server is removed from <%= vars.ops_manager %> v3.0.

If you upgrade to <%= vars.ops_manager %> v3.0 from <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10 or earlier, and you had previously configured the BOSH Director to activate
the BOSH System Metrics Server, you must deactivate the **Enable deprecated BOSH System Metrics Server** checkbox and activate the **Enable additional System
Metrics** checkbox in the **Director Config** pane of the BOSH Director tile before you begin upgrading.

### <a id='nsx-v-removed'></a> NSX-V Networking is Removed

NSX-V networking reached EOGS in January 2022. Because of this, you cannot configure NSX-V networking in <%= vars.ops_manager %> v3.0.

You can still configure NSX-T networking for compatible vSphere deployments. For more information, see [Resource Requirements](install/vsphere.html#runtimes)
in _Installing <%= vars.ops_manager %> on vSphere_.

### <a id='keystone-v2-removed'></a> Keystone v2 Authentication is Removed

In OpenStack deployments, Keystone v2 is removed and replaced by Keystone v3 for user authentication.

If you upgrade to <%= vars.ops_manager %> v3.0 from <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10 or earlier, and you had previously used Keystone v2 to authenticate users,
you must re-configure your OpenStack deployment to use Keystone v3 before you begin upgrading.

### <a id='bosh-multihome-removed'></a> Multi-Network Configuration for the BOSH Director VM is Removed

<%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10 and earlier included an undocumented API endpoint that allowed you to configure a second network on the BOSH Director VM. In
<%= vars.ops_manager %> v3.0, this API endpoint is removed, and you can no longer configure a second network on the BOSH Director VM.

### <a id='azure'></a> Azure Germany and Azure Stack Support is Removed

Microsoft ceased operating the Azure Germany cloud platform in 2021. Because of this, you cannot configure an Azure Germany environment in
<%= vars.ops_manager %> v3.0. However, you can still use Germany-based regions in the global Azure Commercial Cloud environment.

You also cannot configure an Azure Stack environment in <%= vars.ops_manager %> v3.0.

### <a id='syslog-custom-rules'></a> Invalid Custom Syslog Rules Cause Errors

Iin <%= vars.ops_manager %> v3.0, invalid custom syslog rules cause <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployments to fail with a relevant error message. In
<%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10 and earlier, invalid custom syslog rules only cause <%= vars.ops_manager %> to log errors and discard the invalid rules.

To avoid deployment failure, validate your custom syslog configuration in one of the following ways:

* As your syslog server is pre-starting, look for a `Custom rule configuration invalid` error message. This error message indicates that one or more of your
custom syslog rules are invalid. You can then edit these custom rules accordingly in the **Custom rsyslog Configuration** field in the **Syslog** pane of the
BOSH Director tile.

* In a terminal window, run `rsyslogd -N1` in a local environment.
