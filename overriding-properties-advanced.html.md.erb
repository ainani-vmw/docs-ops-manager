title: Overriding Manifest Properties in Advanced Mode
owner: Ops Manager
---

This topic describes how you can use Advanced Mode to override some manifest properties. This allows you to change properties that you cannot change through
the <%= vars.ops_manager_first %> UI or the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

<%= vars.ops_manager %> is an interface to the BOSH Director manifest and the runtime configs
that underlie VMware Tanzu.
<%= vars.ops_manager %> does not allow you to edit the manifest and configs directly.

When you configure <%= vars.ops_manager %> through the UI or API,
you set many of the properties contained in the manifest and configs.
<%= vars.ops_manager %> sets some other properties for you, and other properties use the default
values provided by VMware Tanzu or BOSH.

Use the manifest property override feature described in this topic to modify properties
that cannot be modified in other ways.


## <a id='process'></a> Procedure

To override manifest properties:

1. If the property that you want to change can be modified through the <%= vars.ops_manager %> UI
or the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API, use the UI or API to change the property.

1. If the property cannot be modified through the <%= vars.ops_manager %> UI or the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API:
    1. Determine if the property can be overridden. See [Overridable Properties](#properties) below.
    1. If the property is in the BOSH Director Manifest, see [Override BOSH Director Manifest Properties](#bosh-overrides) below.
    1. If the property is in one of the runtime configs, see [Override Runtime Config Properties](#runtime-config-overrides) below.

You can also use the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API to view the BOSH Director manifest,
view the list of overrides for the BOSH Director and runtime configs,
and delete the overrides.
For more information, see [Advanced Manifest Configuration](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-10/api/#tag/Advanced-Manifest-Configuration)
in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API documentation.


## <a id='properties'></a> Overridable Properties

You can edit properties in the BOSH Director manifest, another tile manifest, or two of the runtime configs.

### <a id='bosh-director-manifest'></a> BOSH Director Manifest

In the BOSH Director manifest, you can override properties in the following sections:

* `network`
* `instance_group` `jobs`

You cannot:

* Edit properties in other sections of the BOSH Director manifest
* Add or delete a network
* Add or delete an instance group

For an example, see [Change the Network Type to Dynamic](#example1) below.

### <a id='tile-manifest'></a> Tile Manifest

In the tile manifest, you can override properties in the following sections:

* `features`
* `update`

For an example, see [Change Number of Canary Instances](#example3) or
[Enable Returning DNS Addresses in Links](#example4) below.

### <a id='runtime-configs'></a> Runtime Configs

You can edit properties in two add-ons in each of two of the runtime configs files.
The table below lists these properties:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Runtime Config</th>
    <th>Add-on</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>ops_manager_dns_runtime</code></td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li><code>bosh_dns</code></li>
        <li><code>bosh_dns_windows</code></li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>ops_manager_system_metrics_runtime</code></td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li><code>system_metrics_agent</code></li>
        <li><code>system_metrics_agent_windows</code></li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


## <a id='bosh-overrides'></a> Override BOSH Director Manifest Properties

To override properties in the BOSH Director manifest:

1. Set <%= vars.ops_manager %> to Advanced Mode by following the procedure in
[How to Enable Advanced Mode in the <%= vars.ops_manager %>](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/How-to-Enable-Advanced-Mode-in-the-Ops-Manager?language=en_US)
in the Knowledge Base.
For more information about Advanced Mode,
see [Advanced Mode](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-10/api/#tag/Advanced-Mode)
in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API documentation.

  <div class="note caution"><strong>Caution:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><%= vars.company_name %> recommends that only skilled operators use Advanced Mode in <%= vars.ops_manager %>.
        If you use Advanced Mode incorrectly, you can disable or destroy your deployment.</li>
      <li><%= vars.ops_manager %> does not validate the properties that you change using Advanced Mode.
        For example, if you enter a string where an integer is required, you do not receive an error.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

1. Use the `/api/v0/staged/director/overrides` endpoint. For more information, see

in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API documentation.

1. After you have completed your changes, disable Advanced Mode by following the procedure in
[How to Enable Advanced Mode in the Ops Manager](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/How-to-Enable-Advanced-Mode-in-the-Ops-Manager?language=en_US)

## <a id='examples'></a> Examples of Overridable Properties

This section contains examples of properties that customers have asked to override.

### <a id='example1'></a> BOSH Director Manifest Example: Change the Network Type to Dynamic

By default, the network type is set to `manual`.
You cannot change this property through the  UI or API.

You can override this default by changing the value of the `type` property
in the `networks` section of the BOSH Director manifest.

### <a id='example3'></a> Tile Manifest Example: Change Number of Canary Instances

By default, the number of canary instances is set to 1.
You cannot change this property through the  UI or API.

You can override this default by changing the number of canary instances
in the `update` section of the tile manifest.

For a list of all the properties you can change in the `update` section,
see [Update Block](https://bosh.io/docs/manifest-v2/#update) in the BOSH documentation.

### <a id='example4'></a> Tile Manifest Example: Enable Returning DNS Addresses in Links

By default, `use_dns_addresses` is set to `false`.
You cannot change this property through the  UI or API.

You can override this default by changing the value to `true`
in the `features` section of the tile manifest.

For a list of all the properties you can change in the `features` section,
see [Features Block](https://bosh.io/docs/manifest-v2/#features) in the BOSH documentation.

### <a id='example2'></a> Runtime Config Example: Change the Timeout for the BOSH DNS Network Health Check

By default, the network timeout for synchronous health checks is 1 second.
You cannot change this property through the  UI or API.

You can override this default by changing the value of the
`health.health.synchronous_check_timeout` property
in the `bosh-dns` add-on of the `ops_mananger_dns_runtime` runtime config.
