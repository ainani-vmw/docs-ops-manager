This topic describes how to log into Ops Manager for the first time after a new Ops Manager deployment.

This topic also describes how to configure the Ops Manager default authentication with either SAML, LDAP, or internal authentication.

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

When you have a new installation of Ops Manager, you choose the default authentication and login method.

When you log in for the first time, you go to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in your web browser. You configure the FQDN when you first deploy Ops Manager. To log in, see [Log In to Ops Manager For the First Time](#login-first-time) below.

Your login method and authentication choices are:

* **[Internal Authentication](#internal):** Ops Manager maintains and manages your user database.

* **[SAML Identity Provider](#saml):** An external identity server maintains your user database.

* **[LDAP Server](#ldap):** An external identity server maintains your user database.

## <a id='login-first-time'></a> Log In to Ops Manager For the First Time

To log in to Ops Manager for the first time with a new Ops Manager deployment:

1. In a web browser, navigate to Ops Manager using your FQDN. You set your FQDN when you configure Ops Manager before deployment.

1. When Ops Manager starts for the first time, choose one of the following procedures below:
    * [Internal Authentication](#internal)
    * [SAML Identity Provider](#saml)
    * [LDAP Server](#ldap)

## <a id='internal'></a> Log In to Ops Manager with Internal Authentication

To set up internal authentication that Ops Manager maintains:

1.  When redirected to the **Internal Authentication** page, do the following:
    * Enter a **Username**, **Password**, and **Password confirmation** to create an Admin user.
    * Enter a **Decryption passphrase** and the **Decryption passphrase confirmation**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager datastore and is not recoverable.
    * If you are using an **HTTP proxy** or **HTTPS proxy**, follow the instructions in [Configuring Proxy Settings for the BOSH CPI](./install/pcf-director-proxy-settings.html).
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.
    * Click **Setup Authentication**.

1. Log in to Ops Manager with the Admin username and password you created in the previous step.
