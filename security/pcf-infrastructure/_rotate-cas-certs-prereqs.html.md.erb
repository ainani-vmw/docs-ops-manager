Before you rotate certificates:


* You must have <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10.

* You must reset any certificates that were manually set in CredHub on
<%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.6 and earlier to prevent them from being rotated with
other certificates generated by CredHub. To find and reset any manually set
certificates in CredHub, see [Reviewing Manually Set Certificates in CredHub]
(manual-credhub-certificate.html).

* You cannot have any version of <%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>)
installed and rotate CredHub-managed certificates with the Ops Manager API.
Instead, you can follow this procedure to rotate certificates
managed by <%= vars.ops_manager %>. Then, to rotate certificates managed in CredHub,
see [Advanced Certificate Rotation with CredHub Maestro](advanced-certificate-rotation.html).

* Your product tile must have one of the following versions installed to rotate
CredHub-managed certificates with the Ops Manager API:
    * <%= vars.app_runtime %> v2.7.21 or later
    * <%= vars.app_runtime %> v2.8.2 or later
    * <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile v2.7.21 or later
    * <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile v2.8.2 or later
    * Small Footprint <%= vars.app_runtime %> v2.7.21 or later
    * Small Footprint <%= vars.app_runtime %> v2.8.2 or later
    * <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> v2.7.17 or later
    * <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> v2.8.2 or later

If you have an earlier version of a product tile listed above, use this procedure
to rotate certificates managed only by <%= vars.ops_manager %>. Then,
to rotate certificates managed in CredHub, see [Advanced Certificate Rotation with CredHub Maestro]
(advanced-certificate-rotation.html).
