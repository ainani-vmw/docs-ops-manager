title: Rotating configurable Tanzu Operations Manager leaf certificates
owner: Ops Manager

This topic describes how you can rotate configurable leaf certificates for your <%= vars.ops_manager_first %> deployment. To rotate all
certificates in your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment, see [Rotating CAs and Leaf Certificates](rotate-cas-and-leaf-certs.html).

You can generate configurable certificates and paste them into <%= vars.ops_manager %> configuration panes
where ever needed. Examples include certificates that stop SSL traffic into <%= vars.app_runtime_first %>, or authenticate a Single Sign-On for VMware Tanzu service plan to an external SAML server.

To rotate SAML certificates for both <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> and the Single Sign-On for VMware Tanzu service, see [Rotating identity provider SAML certificates](rotate-saml-ca.html).

<p> This procedure does not rotate the <%= vars.ops_manager %> root certificate authority (CA) or other CAs in your deployment.
To rotate CAs and leaf certificates, see <a href="rotate-cas-and-leaf-certs.html">Rotating CAs and Leaf Certificates</a>.</p>

<%= partial 'minimum-duration' %>

To rotate configurable leaf certificates:

1. Go to <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. For each certificate you want to rotate:
  1. Find the text box where the leaf certificate is configured within the <%= vars.ops_manager %> UI. You
  might need to look through multiple configuration panes to identify the location of the certificate configuration text field. The tile might not expose the field via the UI, in that case the value needs to be updated via the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API. Use the following fields to identify the location of the certificate configuration text field:
      * The `product_guid` text box in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API output can help identify the tile in which the certificate is configured. For example, the prefix `p-bosh-` refers to the BOSH Director tile, and the prefix `cf-` refers to the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile.
      * The `property_reference` text box in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API output can help identify the configuration pane in which the certificate is configured. For example, the `uaa.service_provider_key_credentials` property is configured in the **UAA** pane of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile.
  1. Copy a new value for the leaf certificate into the text field or generate a new leaf certificate using the **Generate RSA Certificate** button.
  1. Click **Save** for each value you that you added new leaf certificates.

1. Return to <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.

1. Click **Apply Changes**.

## <a id='specialized-procedures'></a> Certificates with specialized procedures

Some certificates are not rotated when using the standard rotation procedure. The following table lists
certificates that use a separate, specialized rotation procedure and provides links to documentation and Knowledge Base articles to help you rotate these certificates.
