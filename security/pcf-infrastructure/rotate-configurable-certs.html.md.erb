This topic describes how to rotate configurable leaf certificates for your Ops Manager deployment. To rotate all certificates in your deployment, see [Rotating the Root CA and Leaf Certificates](rotate-cas-and-leaf-certs.html).


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Configurable certificates are generated by the user and pasted into Ops Manager configuration panes where needed. Examples include certificates that terminate SSL traffic into Pivotal Application Service (PAS), or authenticate a Pivotal Single Sign-On (SSO) service plan to an external SAML server.

To rotate SAML certificates for both PAS and the SS0 service, see [Rotating Identity Provider SAML Certificates](rotate-saml-ca.html).

<p class='note warning'><strong>Warning:</strong> This procedure does not rotate the Ops Manager root certificate authority (CA) or other CAs in your deployment. To rotate CAs and leaf certificates, see <a href="rotate-cas-and-leaf-certs.html">Rotating the Root CA and Leaf Certificates</a>.</p>


## <a id='procedure'></a> Procedure

To rotate configurable leaf certificates:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. For each certificate you want to rotate:
  1. Find the text field where the certificate is configured in the Ops Manager UI.
      * The `product_guid` field in the Ops Manager API output can help identify the tile in which the certificate is configured. For example, the prefix `p-bosh-` refers to the BOSH Director tile, and the prefix `cf-` refers to the PAS tile.
      * The `property_reference` field in the Ops Manager API output can often help identify the configuration pane in which the certificate is configured. For example, the `uaa.service_provider_key_credentials` property is configured in the **UAA** pane of the PAS tile.
      * You might need to look through multiple configuration panes to identify where a certificate is configured.
  1. Paste a new value for the certificate into the field.
  1. Click **Save** at the bottom of each pane in which you have provided new certificates.

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.

1. Click **Apply Changes**.
