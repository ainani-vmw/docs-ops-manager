title: Accessing BOSH CredHub with the CredHub CLI
owner: Ops Manager
---

<%= vars.ops_manager_first %> stores some of its internal CA (certificate authority) and non-CA certificates in the BOSH CredHub credentials store. This topic describes how you can use the CredHub CLI to access BOSH CredHub.

For example, you might need to access BOSH CredHub to rotate the Services TLS CA and its leaf certificates. For more information, see [Rotating the Services TLS
CA and Its Leaf Certificates](services_tls_ca_rotate.html).

For information about BOSH CredHub, see the [CredHub documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/credhub/#bosh).

## <a id='credhub'></a> Procedure

To access the BOSH CredHub credentials store, you must retrieve credentials from the BOSH Director and then use the credentials to log in to CredHub from the
<%= vars.ops_manager %> VM.

1. In the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard, click the **BOSH Director** tile.

1. Click the **Credentials** tab.

1. In the **BOSH Director** section, click the link to the **BOSH Commandline Credentials**.

1. Record the values for `BOSH_CLIENT` and `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET`.<br>
  For example:

    ```
    {"credential":"BOSH_CLIENT=ops_manager
    BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=abCdE1FgHIjkL2m3n-3PqrsT4EUVwXy5
    BOSH_CA_CERT=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
    BOSH_ENVIRONMENT=10.0.0.5 bosh "}
    ```

    The `BOSH_CLIENT` is the BOSH CredHub client name and the `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET` is
    the BOSH CredHub client secret.

1. Follow the procedure in
[Gather Credential and IP Address Information](../../install/trouble-advanced.html#gather-credential-and-ip-address-information-1)
to obtain the information needed to log in to the BOSH Director VM.
Record the IP address for the BOSH Director and the Director Credentials.

1. Log in to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM by following the procedure in
[Log Into the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM with SSH](../../install/ssh-login.html#ssh-by-iaas).

1. From the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM, set the API target of the CredHub CLI to your BOSH
CredHub server by running the following command:

    ```
    credhub api  \
    https://BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP:8844 \
    --ca-cert=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
    ```

    Where `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the IP address of the BOSH Director VM you previously recorded.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ credhub api \
    https://10.0.0.5:8844 \
    --ca-cert=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
    </pre>

1. Log in to CredHub by running the following command:

    ```
    credhub login \
    --client-name=CREDHUB-CLIENT-NAME \
    --client-secret=CREDHUB-CLIENT-SECRET
    ```

    Where:

    * `CREDHUB-CLIENT-NAME` is the value you recorded for `BOSH_CLIENT` earlier in this procedure.
    * `CREDHUB-CLIENT-SECRET` is the value you recorded for `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET` earlier in this procedure.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ credhub login \
    --client-name=credhub \
    --client-secret=abcdefghijklm123456789
    </pre>
