This topic describes <%= vars.ops_manager_first %> certificate sources, and how <%= vars.ops_manager %> uses certificates to secure both internal and external networking calls.

## <a id='sources'></a> Certificate sources

Certificates in <%= vars.ops_manager %> originate from these sources:

* [Enterprise Root Certificate Authority (CA)](#enterprise-root-ca).

* [CredHub](#credhub).

### <a id='enterprise-root-ca'></a> Enterprise root CA

An enterprise root CA is able to grant itself a certificate and create subordinate CAs. Domains require an enterprise root CA to enable clients to request certificates.

Generating certificates against a root CA is a good implementation for systems that are static and do not need highly available certificate creation.

### <a id='credhub'></a> CredHub

You can use CredHub as a source for certificates in <%= vars.ops_manager %>. These certificates can either be self-signed or signed by an imported trusted CA. Certificates are self-signed by default.

Use CredHub for:

* High availability.

* Dynamic generation of certificates.

* More secure communication between platform components, apps, and services.

<%= vars.company_name %> recommends using CredHub for high availability and good security posture in <%= vars.ops_manager %>.

For more information, see [CredHub](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/4.0/tas-for-vms/credhub-index.html).
