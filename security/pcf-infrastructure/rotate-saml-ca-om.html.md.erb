title: Rotating identity provider SAML certificates for Tanzu Operations Manager
owner: Ops Manager
---

You can rotate SAML service provider (SP) credentials for your <%= vars.ops_manager_first %>.

SAML SP credentials are one example of configurable certificates in <%= vars.ops_manager %>.
When <%= vars.ops_manager %> is configured to use SAML as an IDP, it uses a configurable certificate
authority (CA) certificate to authenticate to an external SAML server. This CA has a
two-year expiration period.

Follow this procedure:

1. Go to **Settings**, then **SAML Settings**.
1. Under the **SAML service provider certificate and private key** text box, click **Change**.
1. You can provide your own certificate and private key or you can click **Generate RSA Key**.
    1. In the **Generate RSA Key** dialog box, use the FQDN of <%= vars.ops_manager %> as your domain name.
1. Click **Save**.
1. Apply the changes by deploying the BOSH Director.
