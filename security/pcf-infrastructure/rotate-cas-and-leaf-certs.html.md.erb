title: Rotating CAs and Leaf Certificates
owner: Ops Manager
---

This topic describes how to rotate certificate authorities (CAs) and leaf certificates using the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API. To rotate only leaf certificates, see one of the leaf certificate rotation topics listed in [Certificate Rotation Procedures](api-cert-rotation.html#procedures) in _Overview of Certificate Rotation_.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

This procedure uses the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API to rotate the <%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA and leaf certificates. When you rotate the <%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA, the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API automatically rotates the BOSH NATS CA as well as CAs stored in CredHub, such as the BOSH DNS CA and the Diego root CA.

This procedure includes three redeploys. The first deploy adds the new CA certificates to
<%= vars.ops_manager %> components. The second deploy replaces the old leaf certificates
with the new leaf certificates. The third deploy removes the old CA certificates, leaving
only the new CA certificates.

## <a id='procedure'></a> Procedure

To rotate CAs, configurable leaf certificates, and non-configurable leaf certificates:

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> You must complete these steps in the exact order specified. Otherwise, you may damage your deployment.</p>

1. Add a new <%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA. This step also automatically adds new CAs for all CAs visible to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API. For more information, see [Add New CAs](#add-new-ca) below.

1. Activate the <%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA. This step also automatically activates any other new CAs added in the previous step. For more information, see [Activate the CAs](#activate-new-ca) below.

1. Rotate configurable leaf certificates. For more information, see [Rotate Configurable Leaf Certificates](#rotate-config-after-new-root) below.

1. Rotate non-configurable leaf certificates. For more information, see [Rotate Non-Configurable Leaf Certificates from the New CAs](#regenerate-from-new-root) below.

1. Delete the old root CA and mark the old CAs in CredHub as inactive. For more information, see [Delete the Old Root CA and Mark Old CAs in CredHub as Inactive](#delete) below.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> The Services TLS CA, <code>/services/tls_ca</code>,
cannot be rotated using this procedure. For information about how to rotate the Services TLS CA, see <a href="advanced-certificate-rotation.html#services-rotation">Rotate the Services TLS CA and Its Leaf Certificates</a> in <em>Advanced Certificate Rotation with CredHub Maestro</em>.</p>

### <a id='add-new-ca'></a> Step 1: Add New CAs

This section describes how to add a new root CA for <%= vars.ops_manager %>. The new root CA can be an <%= vars.ops_manager %>-generated CA or your own custom CA.

This procedure also automatically regenerates the BOSH NATS CA as well as CAs stored in CredHub, such as the BOSH DNS CA and the Diego root CA.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> The <%= vars.ops_manager %> API also excludes from rotation the CAs for certain versions of the VMware Tanzu SQL [MySQL for VMs], Redis for VMware Tanzu, VMware Tanzu RabbitMQ, and VMware Tanzu GemFire tiles and IPsec for VMware Tanzu. For information about rotating these CAs, see the documentation for those products.</p>

To add new CAs:

1. If you have not already done so, follow the procedure in [Using <%= vars.ops_manager %> API](../../install/ops-man-api.html) to target and authenticate with the <%= vars.ops_manager %> UAA server. Record your <%= vars.ops_manager %> access token, and use it for `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` in the following steps.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When you record your <%= vars.ops_manager %> access token, remove any newline characters such as <code>\n</code>.</p>

1. Use <%= vars.ops_manager %> to generate a new CA, or add your own custom CA:
  <p class ="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) certificates are not supported in <%= vars.ops_manager %>.</p>
  * **To use your own custom CA:** Call the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API `certificate_authorities` endpoint by running:

        ```
        curl "https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/api/v0/certificate_authorities" \
            -X POST \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{"cert_pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----CUSTOM-CERTIFICATE", "private_key_pem": "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----RSA-KEY"}'
            -i
        ```
        Where:
        * `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` is the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment.
        * `CUSTOM-CERTIFICATE` is your custom CA.
        * `RSA-KEY` is your RSA key.
        * `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is your UAA access token.
        <br>
        <br>
        If the command succeeds, the API returns a response that includes the new CA. For example:
        <pre class="terminal">
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        {
              "certificate\_authorities": [
                {
                  "guid": "f7bc18f34f2a7a9403c3",
                  "issuer": "CUSTOM-CERTIFICATE",
                  "created\_on": "2017-01-09",
                  "expires\_on": "2021-01-09",
                  "active": true,
                  "cert\_pem": "\-\-\-\-\-BEGIN CERTIFICATE\-\-\-\-\-\nMIIC+zCCAeOgAwIBAgI....etc"
                }
              ]
        }
        </pre>
  * **To use an <%= vars.ops_manager %>-generated CA:** Call the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API `generate` endpoint by running:

        ```
        curl "https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/api/v0/certificate_authorities/generate" \
              -X POST \
              -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" \
              -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
              -d '{}'
              -i
        ```
        Where:
        * `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` is the FQDN of your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment.
        * `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is your UAA access token.
        <br>
        <br>
        If the command succeeds, the API returns a response that includes the new CA. For example:
        <pre class="terminal">
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        {
              "guid": "f7bc18f34f2a7a9403c3",

        }
        </pre>

1. Confirm that the new CA is added by listing all the CAs for <%= vars.ops_manager %>. Run:

    ```
    curl "https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/api/v0/certificate_authorities" \
          -X GET \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"
          -i
    ```
    Where:
    * `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` is the FQDN of your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment.
    * `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is your UAA access token.
    <br>
    <br>
    The API call returns the GUID of the newly added CA. For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    {
          "certificate\_authorities": [
            {
              "guid": "f7bc18f34f2a7a9403c3",
              "issuer": "VMware",
              "created\_on": "2017-01-09",
              "expires\_on": "2021-01-09",
              "active": true,
              "cert\_pem": "\-\-\-\-\-BEGIN CERTIFICATE\-\-\-\-\-\nMIIC+zCCAeOgAwIBAgI....etc"
            }
            {
              "guid": "a8ee01e33e3e3e3303e3",
              "issuer": "VMware",
              "created\_on": "2017-04-09",
              "expires\_on": "2021-04-09",
              "active": false,
              "cert\_pem": "\-\-\-\-\-BEGIN CERTIFICATE\-\-\-\-\-\nzBBBC+eAAAe1gAwAAAeZ....etc"
            }
          ]
    }
    </pre>

1. Identify the newly added CA, which has `active` set to `false`. Record its GUID.

1. Navigate to `https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` in a browser, where `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` is the FQDN of your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment.

1. Log in to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the **BOSH Director** tile.

1. Select **Director Config**.

1. Enable the **Recreate VMs deployed by the BOSH Director** checkbox.
This propagates the new CA to the BOSH Agent on each VM deployed by the BOSH Director,
which enables the new leaf certificates to trust the new CA.

1. Return to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. If you have service tiles installed, for each service tile:
    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The names of the <strong>Upgrade all service instances</strong> and <strong>Recreate all service instances</strong> errands may be slightly different between services.</p>
    1. Click the tile.
    1. Click the **Errands** tab.
    1. Enable the **Upgrade all service instances** errand. Running this errand is necessary to push CredHub certificate updates to each service instance.
    1. If the service tile has the **Recreate all service instances** errand:
        1. Enable the **Recreate all service instances** errand. Running this errand pushes BOSH Agent certificate updates to service instances.
        1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
        1. Click **Apply Changes**.
    1. If the service tile does not have the **Recreate all service instances** errand:
        1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
        1. Click **Apply Changes**.
        1. When the deploy finishes, manually push BOSH Agent certificate updates to each service instance. For each service instance, run:

            ```
            bosh -d SERVICE-INSTANCE-DEPLOYMENT recreate
            ```
            Where `SERVICE-INSTANCE-DEPLOYMENT` is the BOSH deployment name for the service instance.

1. If you do not have any service tiles installed:
    1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
    1. Click **Apply Changes**.

1. When the deploy finishes and you have completed all necessary tasks to update service instances, continue to the next section, [Activate the CAs](#activate-new-ca).

### <a id='activate-new-ca'></a> Step 2: Activate the CAs

To activate the CAs that you added in [Add New CAs](#add-new-ca) above:

1. Call the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API `activate` endpoint by running:

    ```
    curl "https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/api/v0/certificate_authorities/CERTIFICATE-GUID/activate" \
      -X POST \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{}'
      -i
    ```
    Where:
    * `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` is the FQDN of your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment.
    * `CERTIFICATE-GUID` is the GUID of your CA that you retrieved in the previous section.
    * `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is your UAA access token.
    <br>
    <br>
    The API returns a successful response:
    <pre class="terminal">HTTP/1.1 200 OK</pre>

1. List your CAs to confirm that the new <%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA is active. Run:

    ```
    curl "https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/api/v0/certificate_authorities" \
          -X GET \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"
          -i
    ```
    Where:
    * `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` is the FQDN of your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment.
    * `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is your UAA access token.

1. Examine the response to ensure that your new root CA has the `active` property set to `true`.

### <a id='rotate-config-after-new-root'></a> Step 3: Rotate Configurable Leaf Certificates

Any configurable leaf certificates generated from the <%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA must be rotated. These are the leaf certificates that you generated using the **Generate RSA Certificate** button in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> UI. For example, see [Providing a Certificate for Your TLS Termination Point](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/operating/security_config.html) in the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> documentation.

To regenerate and rotate each configurable leaf certificate that expires soon:

1. Find the text field where the leaf certificate is configured within the <%= vars.ops_manager %> UI. You might need to look through multiple configuration panes to identify the location of the certificate configuration text field. Use the following fields to identify the location of the certificate configuration text field:
    * The `product_guid` field in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API output can help identify the tile in which the certificate is configured. For example, the prefix `p-bosh-` refers to the BOSH Director tile, and the prefix `cf-` refers to the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile.
    * The `property_reference` field in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API output can help identify the configuration pane in which the certificate is configured. For example, the `uaa.service_provider_key_credentials` property is configured in the **UAA** pane of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile.

1. Copy a new value for the leaf certificate into the text field or generate a new leaf certificate using the **Generate RSA Certificate** button.

1. Click **Save** at the bottom of each pane in which you added new leaf certificates.

### <a id='regenerate-from-new-root'></a> Step 4: Rotate Non-Configurable Leaf Certificates from the New CAs

After activating the new <%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA and other CAs, you must rotate non-configurable leaf certificates from the new CAs.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> The <%= vars.ops_manager %> API also excludes from rotation the CAs for certain versions of the VMware Tanzu SQL [MySQL for VMs], Redis for VMware Tanzu, VMware Tanzu RabbitMQ, and VMware Tanzu GemFire tiles and IPsec for VMware Tanzu. For information about rotating these CAs, see the documentation for those products.</p>

To rotate non-configurable leaf certificates:

1. Call the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API `regenerate` endpoint by running:

    ```
    curl "https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/api/v0/certificate_authorities/active/regenerate" \
          -X POST \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{}'
          -i
    ```
    Where:
    * `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` is the FQDN of your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment.
    * `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is your UAA access token.
    <br>
    <br>
    The API returns a successful response:
    <pre class="terminal">HTTP/1.1 200 OK</pre>

1. Navigate to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the **BOSH Director** tile.

1. Select **Director Config**.

1. Enable the **Recreate VMs deployed by the BOSH Director** checkbox. This propagates the new CAs to all VMs deployed by the BOSH Director to prevent downtime.

1. Return to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. If you have service tiles installed, for each service tile:
    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The names of the <strong>Upgrade all service instances</strong> and <strong>Recreate all service instances</strong> errands may be slightly different between services.</p>
    1. Click the tile.
    1. Click the **Errands** tab.
    1. Enable the **Upgrade all service instances** errand. Running this errand is necessary to push CredHub certificate updates to each service instance.
    1. If the service tile has the **Recreate all service instances** errand:
        1. Enable the **Recreate all service instances** errand. Running this errand pushes BOSH Agent certificate updates to service instances.
        1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
        1. Click **Apply Changes**.
    1. If the service tile does not have the **Recreate all service instances** errand:
        1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
        1. Click **Apply Changes**
        1. When the deploy finishes, manually push BOSH Agent certificate updates to each service instance. For each service instance, run:

            ```
            bosh -d SERVICE-INSTANCE-DEPLOYMENT recreate
            ```
            Where `SERVICE-INSTANCE-DEPLOYMENT` is the BOSH deployment name for the service instance.

1. If you do not have any service tiles installed:
    1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
    1. Click **Apply Changes**

1. When the deploy finishes and you have completed all necessary tasks to update service instances, continue to the next section, [Delete the Old Root CA and Mark Old CAs in CredHub as Inactive](#delete).

### <a id='delete'></a> Step 5: Delete the Old Root CA and Mark Old CAs in CredHub as Inactive

After activating new CAs and rotating leaf certificates from the new CAs, you must:

* Delete the old <%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA from your deployment.
* Mark the old CAs stored in CredHub as inactive.

Within CredHub, the leaf certificates that are generated when you rotate your deployment's root CA are associated with both the new and old versions of the root CA. Deleting the old root CA ensures that these leaf certificates are only associated with the new root CA.

The <%= vars.ops_manager %> API call you use to delete your deployment's old root CA also marks the old versions of all CAs stored in CredHub as inactive, including those not generated by the old root CA.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This procedure does not delete leaf certificates stored in CredHub. It marks CredHub leaf certificates as transitional, which indicates that the leaf certificate is inactive. To delete CredHub leaf certificates, use the CredHub Maestro garbage collection feature. For information about CredHub Maestro certificate garbage collection, see <a href="advanced-certificate-rotation.html#garbage-collection">Delete Inactive Certificate Versions</a> in <em>Advanced Certificate Rotation with CredHub Maestro</em>.</p>

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Before you delete the old CA, ensure that you reviewed the <strong>Review Pending Changes</strong> page and clicked <strong>Apply Changes</strong> as part of <a href="#regenerate-from-new-root">Rotate Non-Configurable Leaf Certificates from the New CAs</a> above.</p>

To delete the old <%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA and mark the old CredHub CAs as inactive:

1. List your root CAs to retrieve the GUID of the old, inactive <%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA. Run:

    ```
    curl "https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/api/v0/certificate_authorities" \
          -X GET \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"
          -i
    ```
    Where:
    * `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` is the FQDN of your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment.
    * `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is your UAA access token.

1. Delete the old <%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA by running:

    ```
    curl "https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/api/v0/certificate_authorities/OLD-CERTIFICATE-GUID" \
          -X DELETE \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"
          -i
    ```
    Where:
    * `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` is the FQDN of your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment.
    * `OLD-CERTIFICATE-GUID` is the GUID of the old <%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA.
    * `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is your UAA access token.
