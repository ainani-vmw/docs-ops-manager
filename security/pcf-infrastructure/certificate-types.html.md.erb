This topic describes the types of certificates used in Ops Manager that require
planned rotation.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Ops Manager uses certificate authorities (CAs) and various leaf certificates.
CAs are self-signed certificates that issue leaf certificates. CAs can be custom or generated
by Ops Manager.

Leaf certificates are signed by a CA and are used to identify resources in Ops Manager.
Both root CAs and leaf certificates require planned rotation in Ops Manager.

In addition to the types of certificates listed in this topic, some
products issue their own tile certificates that are not managed by or visible to the Ops Manager
API. These tile certificates do not require planned rotation because they rotate automatically
with product upgrades.

Pivotal Application Service (Pivotal Application Service) and VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition
(TKGI) both use tile certificates in addition to their Ops Manager
certificates.


## <a id='types'></a> Certificate Types

The following types of Ops Manager certificates require planned rotation:

* **Ops Manager root CA:** The Ops Manager root CA issues other certificates
that Ops Manager uses. The root CA can be an Ops Manager-generated
CA or your own custom CA. The Ops Manager root CA expires four years after creation.
For more information about viewing the root CAs for Ops Manager, see [Listing the
Root Certificate Authorities](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-7/opsman-api/#tag/Certificate-Authorities/paths/~1api~1v0~1certificate_authorities/get) in the Ops Manager
API documentation.

* **Other internal CAs:** The following CAs are used primarily for internal purposes:
  * **BOSH NATS CA:** The BOSH NATS CA is rotated automatically when you rotate the Ops Manager
  root CA.
  * **BOSH DNS CAs:** The BOSH DNS CAs are managed by CredHub and applied automatically.

* **Non-configurable certificates:** Non-configurable certificates are leaf certificates either
created by a CA stored in Ops Manager, or created and stored by CredHub and managed
by Ops Manager calls to the CredHub API. Non-configurable certificates are issued
directly by the Ops Manager root CA, or by intermediate CAs in a chain of trust
originated by the root CA. Non-configurable certificates expire after two years. For more
information about about viewing non-configurable leaf certificates, see [Getting Information
About Certificates from Products](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-7/opsman-api/#tag/Certificates/paths/~1api~1v0~1deployed~1certificates/get) in the Ops Manager
API documentation. For more information about generating non-configurable leaf certificates,
see [Generating New Certificates](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-7/opsman-api/#tag/Certificates/paths/~1api~1v0~1certificates~1generate/post) in the Ops Manager
API documentation.

* **Configurable certificates:** Configurable certificates are leaf certificates supplied by
the user and pasted into configuration fields in Ops Manager. Some configuration
panes include a **Generate RSA Certificate** button that supplies valid certificates, but users
can obtain configurable certificates from elsewhere. Configurable certificates generated by
Ops Manager typically expire after two years. For more information about viewing
configurable leaf certificates, see [Getting Information About Certificates from Products]
(https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-7/opsman-api/#tag/Certificates/paths/~1api~1v0~1deployed~1certificates/get) in the Ops Manager API documentation.

* **Non-rotatable certificates:** Non-rotatable certificates are leaf certificates that, like
non-configurable certificates, are issued by the root CA. Unlike non-configurable certificates,
non-rotatable certificates cannot be rotated by the Ops Manager API. For more
information about viewing non-rotatable leaf certificates, see [Getting Information About
Certificates from Products](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-7/opsman-api/#tag/Certificates/paths/~1api~1v0~1deployed~1certificates/get) in the Ops Manager API
documentation.
