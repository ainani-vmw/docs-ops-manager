This topic describes how to rotate non-configurable leaf certificates for your Ops Manager deployment. To rotate all certificates in your deployment, see [Rotating the Root CA and Leaf Certificates](rotate-cas-and-leaf-certs.html).


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

This procedure rotates non-configurable leaf certificates visible to the Ops Manager API.

<p class='note warning'><strong>Warning:</strong> This procedure does not rotate the Ops Manager root certificate authority (CA) or other CAs in your deployment. To rotate CAs and leaf certificates, see <a href="rotate-cas-and-leaf-certs.html">Rotating the Root CA and Leaf Certificates</a>.</p>


## <a id='procedure'></a> Procedure

To rotate non-configurable leaf certificates:

1. Call the Ops Manager API `regenerate` endpoint by running:

    ```
    curl "https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/api/v0/certificate_authorities/active/regenerate" \
          -X POST \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{}' \
          -i
    ```
    Where:
    * `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` is the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of your Ops Manager deployment.
    * `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is your UAA access token.
    <br>
    <br>
    The API returns a successful response:
    <pre class="terminal">HTTP/1.1 200 OK</pre>
