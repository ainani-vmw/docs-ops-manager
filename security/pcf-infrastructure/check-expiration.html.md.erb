This topic describes how to check the expiration dates and types of the certificate authorities (CAs) and leaf certificates that the <%= vars.ops_manager_first %> API manages. After identifying the types of certificates that expire soon, you can determine which certificate rotation procedure to follow.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

There are two ways to manually check the expiration dates and types of the certificates that the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API manages:

* Through the <%= vars.ops_manager %> UI. For more information, see [Check Expiration Dates and Certificate Types Through the <%= vars.ops_manager %> UI](#check-ui) below.

* Through the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API. For more information, see [Check Expiration Dates and Certificate Types Through the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API](#check-api) below.

To configure Concourse to automatically monitor expiring certificates, you can use Platform Automation. For more information, see [expiring-certificates](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform-automation/v4.1/tasks.html#expiring-certificates) in the Platform Automation documentation.


## <a id='check-ui'></a> Check Expiration Dates and Certificate Types Through the <%= vars.ops_manager %> UI

The **Certificates** page in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> UI lists the certificates your deployment uses. It is divided into two sections, **Certificates** and **Excluded certificates**.

* The **Certificates** section includes the certificates that the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API attempts to rotate, though some of these certificates must be rotated manually.

* The **Excluded certificates** section includes the certificates that the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API does not attempt to rotate, because they either must be rotated using CredHub Maestro or cannot be rotated safely at all.

To check certificate expiration dates and types through the <%= vars.ops_manager %> UI:

1. Navigate to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. In the top menu, select **Certificates**.

1. In the **Certificates** and **Excluded certificates** sections, check the **Valid until** column for the expiration dates of each certificate and the number of days before expiration.

1. For any certificates expiring soon, use the following rules to identify their types:
    * **Non-rotatable certificates:** Non-rotatable certificates are included in the **Excluded certificates** section at the bottom of the **Certificates** page.
    * **Non-configurable certificates:** The rows for non-configurable leaf certificates contain the following information:
      * **Location:** <%= vars.ops_manager %> or CredHub
      * **Type:** Leaf
      * **Configurable:** No
    * **Configurable certificates:** The rows for configurable leaf certificates contain the following information:
      * **Type:** Leaf
      * **Configurable:** Yes
    * **CAs:** The rows for CAs contain the following information:
      * **Location:** <%= vars.ops_manager %> or CredHub
      * **Type:** CA

1. After you identify the list of certificates that expire soon, follow one of the procedures listed in [Certificate Rotation Procedures](api-cert-rotation.html#procedures) in _Overview of Certificate Rotation_.
    <p class='note caution'><strong>Caution:</strong> The <strong>Excluded certificates</strong> section lists certificates that you cannot safely rotate using the methods described in this topic. To rotate the Services TLS CA certificate and its leaf certificates, see <a href="advanced-certificate-rotation.html#services-rotation">Rotate the Services TLS CA and Its Leaf Certificates</a> in <em>Advanced Certificate Rotation with CredHub Maestro</em>. For all other certificates listed in <strong>Excluded certificates</strong>, contact <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/support">Support</a> for guidance.</p>


## <a id='check-api'></a> Check Expiration Dates and Certificate Types Through the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API

To check certificate expiration dates and types through the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API:

1. Follow the procedure in [Using <%= vars.ops_manager %> API](../../install/ops-man-api.html) to target and authenticate with the <%= vars.ops_manager %> User Account and Authentication (UAA) server. Record your <%= vars.ops_manager %> access token, and use it for `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` in the steps below.
  <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> When you record your <%= vars.ops_manager %> access token, remove any newline characters such as <code>\n</code>.</p>

1. To retrieve the certificates, call the `/deployed/certificates` endpoint of the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API by running:

    ```
    curl "https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/certificates" \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" \
          -i
    ```
    Where:

    * `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` is the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment.
    * `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is the `access_token` value you recorded in the previous step.

    More options:

      * To limit command output to certificates that expire within a given time interval, append `?expires_within=TIME` to the endpoint, replacing `TIME` with an integer-letter code.
        * Valid letter codes are `d` for days, `w` for weeks, `m` for months, and `y` for years. For example, querying to `https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/certificates?expires_within=6m` searches for certificates expiring within six months.
      * To make the JSON output more readable, you can pipe your `curl` command to [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) or another text editor with JSON formatting.

1. The `deployed/certificates` output lists all CAs and leaf certificates visible to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API, whether they are stored in <%= vars.ops_manager %> directly or stored in CredHub. To determine the expiration date and type for each certificate listed:

    1. Determine the expiration date from the `valid_until` value. For example, the root CA listed below expires on August 12, 2020:

        <pre class="terminal">
        {
              "configurable": true,
              "is_ca": true,
              "property_reference": ".properties.root_ca.fb10484dd5541a273c9d",
              "property_type": "rsa_cert_credentials",
              "product_guid": "ops_manager",
              "location": "ops_manager",
              "variable_path": null,
              "issuer": "/CN=ToolsmithsCA",
              "valid_from": "2019-08-13T15:30:22Z",
              "valid_until": "2020-08-12T15:30:22Z"
        }
        </pre>

    2. For any certificates expiring soon, use the following rules to identify their types:
        * **Non-rotatable certificates:** Non-rotatable certificates have the following property value:
            * `variable_path` matches `/p-bosh/service-instance_*/pxc_*`, `/p-bosh/service-instance_*/tls_certificate`, or `/p-bosh/service-instance_*/redis_certificate`
        * **Non-configurable certificates:** Non-configurable leaf certificates have the following property values:
            * `configurable` is `false`
            * `location` is either `ops_manager` or `credhub`
            * `is_ca` is `false`
        * **Configurable certificates:** Configurable leaf certificates have the following property values:
            * `configurable` is `true`
            * `is_ca` is `false`
        * **CAs:** CAs have the following property values:
            * `is_ca` is `true`
            * `location` is `ops_manager` or `credhub`

2. After you identify the list of certificates that expire soon, follow one of the procedures listed in [Certificate Rotation Procedures](api-cert-rotation.html#procedures) in _Overview of Certificate Rotation_.
