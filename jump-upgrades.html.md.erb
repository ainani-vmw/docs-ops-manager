title: Jump Upgrading to Ops Manager v2.10
owner: Ops Manager
---

This topic describes upgrading to <%= vars.ops_manager_first %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>.2 or later directly from <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.5 and later.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Jump upgrading describes the process of skipping minor versions when upgrading <%= vars.ops_manager %>. Jump upgrading enables you to upgrade directly to the long-term support (LTS) version of <%= vars.ops_manager %>, which is <%= vars.v_major_version %>.
<%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10 is supported through April 2024. For more
information, see [Long-Term Support for Ops Manager v2.10](release-notes.html#lts)
in _<%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10 Release Notes_.

## <a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

Before you jump upgrade to <%= vars.ops_manager %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>.2 or later:

* If you are using <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10.8 or earlier, you must complete any in-progress CA rotation before you can jump upgrade. Failure to complete the CA rotation results in the inability to **Apply Changes** due to safety violations.

* If you are on <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.4 or earlier, you must do standard upgrades for each version up to v2.5 before you can jump upgrade to <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

* You must upgrade to <%= vars.ops_manager %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>.2 or later.

* To upgrade to <%= vars.ops_manager %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>, you must ensure that the products you have installed are compatible with <%= vars.ops_manager %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> To create an upgrade path for your product tiles, see the [Upgrade Planner](https://upgrade-planner.pivotal.io/).

* You must have no changes to any product tile or service instance currently staged.

* If you are using vSphere with NSX-T, you must have NSX-T v2.3 or later installed.

## <a id='bosh-dns-migration'></a> BOSH DNS Certificates Regeneration

In <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10.9 and later, BOSH DNS leaf certificates are generated to include the subject alternative name (SAN) field. This migration process is required before you upgrade to <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10.33 and later. If you do not complete this migration before upgrading to v2.10.33 or later, you might experience unexpected BOSH DNS resolution issues until the change is rolled out to all VMs.

When you upgrade to v2.10.9 or later, the BOSH DNS leaf certificates are automatically regenerated to include the SAN field on the next **Apply Changes**.

To allow DNS certificate regeneration and avoid communication issues between system components:

1. Run the **Upgrade service instances** errand on all service tiles.

1. **Apply Changes** to all tiles.


## <a id='jump-upgrade'></a> Jump Upgrade

After you ensure your deployment meets the requirements described in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) above, you can upgrade to <%= vars.ops_manager %> to <%= vars.v_major_version %>.2 or later.

To jump upgrade to <%= vars.ops_manager %> to <%= vars.v_major_version %>.2 or later:

1. Review the table in [Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes) below and address any breaking changes that apply to your current <%= vars.ops_manager %> version.

1. Follow the procedure in [Upgrading <%= vars.ops_manager %>](install/upgrading-pcf.html).


## <a id="breaking-changes"></a> Breaking Changes

The table below describes the breaking changes that affect <%= vars.ops_manager %>
v2.4 through v2.8 and how to address them before upgrading:
