This topic describes how to install Ops Manager on Microsoft Azure.

It includes resource requirements, prerequisites, instructions for installing Ops Manager on Azure, and additional resources.


## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

You can install Ops Manager on Azure, Azure Government Cloud, or Azure Germany. For more information about Azure regions, see [Azure regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/regions/) in the Microsoft Azure documentation.

You can install Ops Manager on Azure with the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) runtime. There are resource requirements specific to both PAS and Azure. Ensure you meet the requirements for PAS and the requirements specific to Azure before installing Ops Manager on Azure. For more information, see [Requirements](#requirements).


## <a id="requirements"></a> Requirements

This section lists the resource requirements for installing Ops Manager on Azure:

* For PAS-specific resource requirements, see [PAS Resource Requirements](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-11/operating/requirements.html).

* For Azure-specific resource requirements, see [Azure Resource Requirements](#azure-requirements) below.

### <a id="azure-requirements"></a> Azure Resource Requirements

The following are the minimum resource requirements for deploying Ops Manager and PAS on Azure:

* An OS disk of 120&nbsp;GB for the Ops Manager VM.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Ops Manager v1.11 requires a Director VM with at least 8&nbsp;GB memory.</p>

* A minimum of the following VM instance limits in your Azure account. The number of VMs required depends on the number of tiles and availability zones you plan to deploy. The following VM guidelines apply to the PAS and Small Footprint PAS runtimes:

  - **PAS**: A new Azure deployment requires the following VMs for PAS and Ops Manager:
<table border='1' class='nice'>
  <tr>
    <th>VM Type</th>
    <th>VM Count</th>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>F1s</td>
    <td>22</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>F2s</td>
    <td>22</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>DS1 v2</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>DS11 v2</td>
    <td>10</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>DS12 v2</td>
    <td>24</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you are deploying a test or sandbox environment that does not require high availability, then you can scale down the number of VM instances in your deployment. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-7/operating/scaling-ert-components.html">Scaling PAS</a>.</p>

  - **Small Footprint PAS**: A new Azure deployment requires the following VMs for Small Footprint PAS and Ops Manager:
<table id='azure-requirements' border="1" class="nice">
  <tr>
  </tr></tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>VM Type</th>
    <th>VM Count</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </tr><tr>
    <th rowspan=4>Small Footprint PAS</th>
    <td>DS11 v2</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>DS12 v2</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>F2s</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>Add 1 to count if using HAProxy</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>F1s</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr><tr>
  	<th rowspan=2>Ops Manager</th>
    <td>DS2 v2</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>F4s</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Some VM instance types are only supported in certain Azure regions. For more information, see <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/services/">Products available by region</a> in the Azure documentation. To deploy Ops Manager on an Azure region that does not support the above VM instance types, you must override the default VM sizes. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-2/opsman-api#overriding-defaults-with-custom-disk-types">Overriding defaults with custom disk types</a> in the Ops Manager API documentation. Changing the default VM sizes may increase the cost of your deployment.</p>


## <a id="prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites

Before installing Ops Manager on Azure, you must:

* Install the Azure CLI v2.0. To install the Azure CLI for your operating system, see [Preparing to Deploy Ops Manager on Azure](../azure/prepare-env-manual.html).

* Configure sufficient IP allocation for PAS. For more information about IP allocation requirements, see [PAS Resource Requirements](#pas).

* Create an SSL certificate for your Ops Manager domain.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To deploy Ops Manager to a production environment, you must obtain a certificate from a certificate authority (CA). <%= vars.company_name %> recommends using a self-signed certificate generated by Ops Manager for development and testing purposes only.</p>

* Assign administrative rights to a domain for Ops Manager. You must be able to add wildcard records to this domain.

* Create a wildcard DNS record that points to your router or load balancer. Alternatively, you can use a service such as xip.io. For example, `203.0.113.0.xip.io`. Then, create at least one wildcard TLS certificate that matches the DNS record you configured.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>  With a wildcard DNS record, every hostname in your domain resolves to the IP address of your router or load balancer. For example, if you create a DNS record `*.example.com` pointing to your router, every app deployed to the `example.com` domain resolves to the IP address of your router.</p>

* Create one or more NTP servers, if the NTP servers are not already provided by your Azure project.

* Install the most recent version of the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI). See [Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads) in GitHub.

* (Optional) Configure external storage. <%= vars.company_name %> recommends using external storage if possible. For more information about how file storage location affects platform performance and stability during upgrades, see [Configure File Storage](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-7/operating/configuring.html#file-storage) in _Configuring PAS for Upgrades_.

* **(Optional)** Configure external databases. Pivotal recommends using external databases in production deployments for BOSH Director and PAS. An external database must be configured to use the UTC timezone.

* (Optional) Configure external user stores. When you deploy Ops Manager, you can select a SAML user store for Ops Manager or a SAML or LDAP user store for PAS, to integrate existing user accounts.
