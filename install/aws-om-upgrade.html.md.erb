## <a id='pcfaws-om-ami'></a> Retrieve Ops Manager AMI ID

Ops Manager has a different AMI ID for each region. Retrieve and record the AMI ID for your region. You use this AMI ID when launching the Ops Manager AMI instance.

To retrieve the AMI ID for Ops Manager:

1. Navigate to the [Ops Manager](https://network.pivotal.io/products/ops-manager) page on VMware Tanzu Network.

1. Select the version of Ops Manager you want to install from the **Releases** dropdown.

1. In the **Release Download Files**, click the file named **Ops Manager for AWS** to download a PDF.

1. Open the PDF and record the AMI ID for your region.


## <a id='pcfaws-om-ami'></a> Launch Ops Manager AMI

Use the AMI ID for your region to launch an AMI instance that hosts the new version of Ops Manager.

To launch the AMI for Ops Manager:

1. Navigate to your EC2 Dashboard.

1. Click **AMIs** from the **Images** menu.

1. Select **Public images** from the dropdown filter that says **Owned by me**.

1. Copy the AMI ID for your region into the search bar and press enter.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> There is a different AMI for each region. If you cannot locate the AMI for your region, verify that you have set your AWS Management Console to your desired region. If you still cannot locate the AMI, log in to the VMware Tanzu Network and file a support ticket.</p>

  1. Right-click the row that lists your AMI and click **Copy AMI**.
  1. Select your **Destination region**.
  1. Enable **Encryption**. For more information about AMI encryption, see [Encryption and AMI Copy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/CopyingAMIs.html#ami-copy-encryption) in _Copying an AMI_ in the AWS documentation.
  1. Select your **Master Key**. To create a new custom key, see [Creating Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html) in the AWS documentation.
  1. Click **Copy AMI**. You can use the new AMI you copied for the next steps.

1. Select the row that lists your Ops Manager AMI and click **Launch**.

1. Choose **m5.large** for your instance type.

1. Click **Next: Configure Instance Details**.

    <%= image_tag("pcfaws/aws_ami_m5large.png", :alt => "AWS instance type selection interface") %>

1. Configure the following fields for your instance:
    * **Network:** Select the VPC that you created.
    * **Subnet:** Select `<%= vars.product_name_lc %>-public-subnet-az0`.
    * **Auto-assign for Public IP:** Select **Enable**.

1. Click **Next: Tag Instance**

1. On the **Add Tags** page, add a tag with the key `Name` and value `<%= vars.product_name_lc %>-ops-manager`.

1. Click **Next: Configure Security Group**.

1. Select the `<%= vars.product_name_lc %>-ops-manager-security-group` that you created in [Configure a Security Group for Ops Manager](../aws/prepare-env-manual.html#pcfaws-om-secgrp) in _Preparing to Deploy Ops Manager on AWS_.

1. Click **Review and Launch** and confirm the instance launch details.

1. Click **Launch**.

1. Select the `<%= vars.product_name_lc %>-ops-manager-key` key pair, confirm that you have access to the private key file, and click **Launch Instances**. You use this key pair to access the Ops Manager VM.

## <a id='dns'></a> Edit Ops Manager DNS A Record

After you deploy the new Ops Manager VM, edit the Ops Manager DNS record in the EC2 dashboard to point to the IP address for the new VM.

To edit the Ops Manager DNS A record:

1. Click **View Instances** to access the **Instances** page on the EC2 Dashboard.

1. Select the VM that you created in the previous section.

1. Locate the **IPv4 Public IP** value in the instance **Description** tab, and record this value for use in the next step.

1. In your DNS provider, edit the **A** record for `<%= vars.product_name_lc %>.SYSTEM-DOMAIN` to point to the IP address recorded in the previous step, where `SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is the system domain of your Ops Manager deployment.
