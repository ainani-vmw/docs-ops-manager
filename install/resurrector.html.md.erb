title: Using the BOSH Resurrector
owner: Ops Manager
---

This topic tells you about the BOSH Resurrector, which monitors VMs and recreates VMs that become unavailable.
You can enable the BOSH Resurrector to ensure high availability (HA) for your <%= vars.ops_manager_first %> deployment.

For vSphere users, this topic explains how to enable vSphere HA to work along with the BOSH Resurrector.

* vSphere HA restarts unreachable VMs at the IaaS level, below the BOSH layer where the BOSH Resurrector operates.

* <%= vars.company_name %> recommends enabling the vSphere HA, the BOSH Resurrector, and a highly-available storage solution to protect the VMs in your deployment.

For more information about the BOSH Resurrector, see
the [Auto-healing Capabilities](https://bosh.io/docs/resurrector/) section of the BOSH documentation.

## <a id='about-resurrector'></a> How the BOSH Resurrector increases Tanzu Operations Manager availability

The BOSH Resurrector increases <%= vars.ops_manager %> availability in the following ways:

* Reacts to hardware failure and network disruptions by recreating virtual machines on active, stable hosts

* Detects operating system failures by continuously monitoring virtual machines and recreating them as required

* Continuously monitors the BOSH Agent running on each virtual machine and recreates the VMs as required

The BOSH Resurrector continuously monitors the status of all virtual machines in a <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment. The Resurrector also monitors the BOSH
Agent on each VM. If either the VM or the BOSH Agent fail, the Resurrector recreates the virtual machine on another active host.

## <a id='limitations'></a> BOSH Resurrector limitations

The following limitations apply to using the BOSH Resurrector:

* The Resurrector does not monitor or protect the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM or the BOSH Director VM.

* The Resurrector might not be able to resolve issues caused by the loss of an entire host.

* The Resurrector does not monitor or protect data storage.

To mitigate these limitations, <%= vars.company_name %> recommends vSphere HA. For more information, see [vSphere HA](#vsphere-ha) below.

## <a id='enabling'></a> Enable the BOSH Resurrector

To enable the BOSH Resurrector:

1. Log into the <%= vars.ops_manager %> web interface.

1. On the Product Dashboard, click **BOSH Director**.

1. In the navigation menu, click **Director Config**.

    ![BOSH Director for vSphere pane, Settings tab, Director Config settings](images/resurrector/resurrector.png)

1. Click **Enable VM Resurrector Plugin** and then click **Save**.


## <a id='vsphere-ha'></a> vSphere HA

The following sections describe vSphere HA, and how to enable it to work along with the BOSH Resurrector.

### <a id='about-vsphere-ha'></a> About vSphere HA

In the event of a host failure, vSphere HA restarts but does not recreate VMs on alternate ESXi hosts in the same cluster. A host failure could result from a sudden power off, crash due to hardware fault, or the vSphere host becoming disconnected from the network. BOSH Resurrector cannot recover from a host failure.

For more information, see [vSphere High Availability](https://bosh.io/docs/vsphere-ha/) in the BOSH documentation.

### <a id='enable-vsphere-ha'></a> Enable vSphere HA

To enable vSphere High Availability:

1. Run the vSphere Management Console.

1. In the left panel, right-click the cluster that contains
the [<%= vars.ops_manager %>](https://tanzu.vmware.com/products) deployment and click **Edit Settings**.

1. Select the **Turn on vSphere High Availability** check box.

1. Click **OK** to enable vSphere High Availability on the cluster.
