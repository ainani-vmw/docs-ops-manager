This topic describes availability zones (AZs) in vSphere and an example of how an operator might scale an app across AZs.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

<%= vars.company_name %> defines an AZ as an operator-assigned, functionally-independent segment of network infrastructure. In cases of partial infrastructure failure, a tile distributes and balances all instances of running apps across remaining AZs. Strategic use of AZs contributes to the fault tolerance and high availability of a tile deployment.

vSphere supports distributing deployments across multiple AZs. For more information, see _Step 4: Create Availability Zones_ in [Configuring BOSH Director on vSphere](../vsphere/config.html#create-az).

<%= vars.company_name %> recommends that customers use three AZs to operate a highly available tile deployment.


## <a id='example-case'></a> Balancing Across AZs During Failure: Example Scenario

An operator scales an app to four instances in a tile environment distributed across three AZs: A1, A2, and A3. The environment allocates the instances according to the Diego Auction. For more information about the Diego Auction, see [How Diego Balances App Processes](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/concepts/diego/diego-auction.html).

For a visual representation of this scenario, see the following diagram:

  <%= image_tag("./common/images/az_er_1.png", :alt => "A box labeled Your Runtime at the top, and three boxes in a row underneath, labeled A1, A2, and A3. A1 contains two App Instances, while A2 and A3 contain one App Instance each.") %>

If A1 experiences a power outage or hardware failure, the two app instances running in A1 terminate while the app instances in zones A2 and A3 continue to run.

For a visual representation of this scenario, see the following diagram:

  <%= image_tag("./common/images/az_er_2.png", :alt => "A box labeled Your Runtime at the top, and three boxes in a row underneath, labeled A1, A2, and A3. A1 contains two App Instances,and both are inactive, while A2 and A3 contain one available App Instance each.") %>

If A1 remains unavailable, the tile balances new instances of the app across the remaining AZs.

For a visual representation of this scenario, see the following diagram:

  <%= image_tag("./common/images/az_er_3.png", :alt => "A box labeled Your Runtime at the top, and three boxes in a row underneath, labeled A1, A2, and A3. A1 is still shown as inactive, and it no longer contains App Instances. A2 and A3 contain one available App Instance each.") %>
