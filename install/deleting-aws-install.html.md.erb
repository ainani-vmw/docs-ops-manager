This topic describes how to delete the AWS resources associated with a <%= vars.ops_manager_first %> deployment.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

When you deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %> to Amazon Web Services (AWS), you provision a set of resources. You can use the AWS console to remove an installation
of all components, but retain the objects in your bucket for a future deployment.

Before you can delete resources from AWS, you must have an account with access to your AWS Management Console.

For more information, see [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) in the AWS documentation.
