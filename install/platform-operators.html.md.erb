This topic describes the roles and permissions of the operator user type in an <%= vars.ops_manager %> and <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) deployment.

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

There are various user types in <%= vars.ops_manager %> and <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployments. Roles are assigned categories that more specifically define functions that a user can perform. For more information about user types in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, see [<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> User Types](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-8/operating/user-types.html).


## <a id="operator-tools-tasks"></a> Operator Tools and Tasks

 Operators fulfill system admin roles covering the entire <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment. They work primarily with their IaaS and Ops Manager to configure and maintain <%= vars.platform_name %> runtime component VMs. The component VMs support the VMs that host apps.

Typical operator tasks include:

* Deploying and configuring Ops Manager, <%= vars.platform_name %> runtimes, and other product and service tiles.
* Maintaining and upgrading <%= vars.platform_name %> deployments.
* Creating user accounts for <%= vars.platform_name %> users and the orgs that the users work within.
* Creating service plans that define the access granted to end users.

## <a id="operator-accounts"></a> Operator User Accounts

When Ops Manager starts up for the first time, the operator specifies one of the following authentication systems for operator user accounts:

* Internal authentication, using a new UAA database that Ops Manager creates.
* External authentication, through an existing identity provider accessed through SAML protocol.

The operator can then use the UAA CLI (UAAC) to create more operator accounts. For more information, see [Creating and Managing Ops Manager User and Client Accounts](../install/opsman-users.html).

## <a id='table'></a> Operator Roles and Permissions

The following table summarizes the <%= vars.platform_name %> operator user type, including their roles, the tools they use, the System of Record (SOR) that stores their accounts, and the accounts that they can provision.
