When you deploy Ops Manager to Google Cloud Platform (GCP), you provision a set of resources. This topic describes how to delete the resources associated with an Ops Manager deployment.

You can delete the resources in one of two ways:

  * If you created a separate project for your Ops Manager deployment, perform the procedure in [Delete the Project](#delete-project).
  * If the project that contains your Ops Manager deployment also contains other resources that you want to preserve, perform the procedure in the [Delete Ops Manager Resources](#delete-resources) section.
