This topic describes the **Review Pending Changes** page and how to selectively deploy individual or multiple tiles in <%= vars.ops_manager_first %>.
Deploying tiles selectively can dramatically reduce deployment time.


## <a id='review-pending-changes'></a> Review Pending Changes Page

The following image shows the **Review Pending Changes** page. The features called out with red letters are described in the following sections.

Each labeled section of the **Review Pending Changes** page works as follows:

* **A** --- **Select All Products:** When activated, the checkbox selects all available tiles. When deactivated, the checkbox deselects all available tiles.

* **B** --- **Select Product:** The checkboxes next to each tile listing allow you to select the tiles you want to deploy. The BOSH Director is always
selected.

* **C** --- **Tile Listing:** Each tile listing displays the version of the tile staged for deployment. The top of each listing shows one of the following
three colors:

  * **Green** --- The tile is configured and ready for deployment.

  * **Orange** --- The tile is not fully configured and cannot be deployed yet.

  * **Red** --- The tile is pending deletion.

* **D** --- **Depends on:** This section lists tile dependencies and versions. If you choose to deploy a tile that has dependencies, you must also deploy all
dependencies for that tile in the same deployment. Dependencies are shown in the following colors:

  * **Green** --- The correct version of the dependency is installed.

	* **Red** --- An incompatible version of the dependency is installed. If the red text includes **(optional)**, you can still deploy the tile.

	* **Gray** --- The dependency is not installed, but it is optional.

* **E** --- **Warnings:** Red text in orange tile listings indicates changes you must make before you deploy the tile. You might see some of the following
warnings:

  * **Missing stemcell(s)** --- You must import and stage one or more stemcells in the Stemcell Library. The warning includes a link to the **Stemcell
  Library** page.

  * **Stemcell(s) out of date** --- You must update one or more stemcells for the tile in the Stemcell Library. For more information, see [Importing and
  Managing Stemcells](../opsguide/managing-stemcells.html).

  * **Configuration is incomplete** --- You must finish configuring the tile.

  * **Configuration is invalid** --- You must resolve invalid configurations within the tile.

* **F** --- **Changes:** This section lists high-level pending changes to the tile that <%= vars.ops_manager %> has not yet attempted to deploy. When
<%= vars.ops_manager %> tries to deploy a tile but the deployment fails, it clears this list, and the pending changes are retained for the next deployment.
To see if a tile has successfully deployed, see [Change Log Page](../pcf-interface.html#changelog) in _Using the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Interface_.

  Listed changes include:

  * Tile deletion is staged.

  * Tile version is updated.

  * Stemcell is added.

  * Stemcell is updated.

* **G** --- **Errands:** If you expand this section, you can activate or deactivate errands that trigger when that tile deploys. For example, you may activate
an errand to log properties. For more information, see [Managing Errands in <%= vars.ops_manager %>](managing_errands.html).

* **H** --- **Staged:** This section indicates the status of the tile.

* **I** --- **See Changes:** When you click this button, it takes you to the **Pending Changes** page for that tile. For more information, see [About Pending Changes
for a Specific Tile](#pending-changes).

* **J** --- **Apply Changes:** Clicking this button deploys all selected tiles.

* **K** --- **Rotate All Non-Configurable Leaf Certificates:** When this checkbox is activated, all non-configurable leaf certificates are rotated as the
first step of re-deployment. The page displays when the next non-configurable leaf certificate is to expire, allowing you to decide whether to activate the
checkbox without needing to look at the **Certificates** page.
  <p class='note important'><strong>Important:</strong> When you activate the <strong>Rotate All Non-Configurable Leaf Certificates</strong> checkbox, you
    must re-deploy all tiles to ensure that all VMs receive the latest version of the certificates. You must also activate the <strong>Upgrade All Service
    instances</strong> errand for any tiles that have that errand. This errand re-deploys VMs associated with service instances, ensuring that they also
    receive the latest version of the certificates. For more information, see
    <a href="../security/pcf-infrastructure/rotate-non-configurable-certs.html">Rotating Non-Configurable Leaf Certificates</a>.</p>


## <a id='pending-changes'></a> About Pending Changes for a Specific Tile

If you have changed the configuration of a tile in your deployment, use the **Pending Changes** page to review the changes to the existing manifest or
configurations line-by-line.

This page summarizes staged changes to the configuration of the existing tile. The changes displayed in this page have not yet been applied to the tile.

This page allows you to verify changes to the manifest and configurations, so you can approve any staged changes before re-deploying tiles.


## <a id='pending-changes-ui'></a> Use the Pending Changes Page

The change summary fields display features that have been activated or deactivated through the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard or
<%= vars.ops_manager %> API. These changes are staged, but have not been implemented yet. You must click **Apply Changes** to put these changes into effect.

To see changes for a specific tile:

1. On the **Review Pending Changes** page, click **See Changes** on the tile you want to review. The **Pending Changes** tab opens.

1. Review the changes that appear. Settings that have been _activated_ are displayed in green with a **+** sign. Settings that have been _deactivated_ are
displayed in red with a **-** sign.

1. Close the **Pending Changes** tab.

1. Return to the **Review Pending Changes** page to apply the changes or review other tiles.

The following screenshot shows changes to the BOSH Director's manifest:

When you make changes to a tile, change summaries are displayed for the following tile areas:

* Manifest

* Runtime configurations

* CPI configurations

* Cloud configurations

If an aspect of the tile has not changed, the change summary displays `No changes`.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Changes to errands do not display in the page UI.</p>
