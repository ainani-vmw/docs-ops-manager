# TLS Connections in VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs

For information on the different paths through which external clients, internal components, app containers,
and app services communicate in <%= vars.app_runtime_first %>, and how the platform uses
Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols to secure these communications, see
[TLS Connections in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/<%= vars.current_major_version %>/operating/networking/tls-info.html).
