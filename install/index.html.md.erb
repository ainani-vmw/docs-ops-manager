This topic provides an overview of how to install and configure Ops Manager.

## <a id="overview"></a> About Ops Manager Installation

Ops Manager installation is a process that involves choosing an IaaS, building the infrastructure, deploying Ops Manager with a VM image, configuring Ops Manager settings, and installing runtimes and services on Ops Manager.

The Ops Manager installation process takes place in the following parts:

- **Prepare Your Ops Manager Deployment:** To prepare your deployment, you must create the required components within your IaaS, which can include load balancers, blobstores, databases, TCP routers, DNS records, and more.

- **Deploy Ops Manager:** To deploy Ops Manager, you must download Ops Manager from <%= vars.product_network %>, create a VM image, create a VM instance, and configure the VM instance to run Ops Manager.

- **Configure Ops Manager:** To configure Ops Manager, you must log into the Ops Manager interface and configure settings.

- **Install Runtimes:** To install runtime tiles, you must download the tile from <%= vars.product_network %> and follow that runtime's procedure to configure and deploy the tile.

- **Install Services:** To install service tiles, you must download the tile from <%= vars.product_network %> and follow that service tile's procedure to configure and deploy the tile.

After you successfully install and configure Ops Manager, you can learn about how to run and operate Ops Manager as an operator. For more information, see [Operator Guide](../opsguide/index.html).

## <a id='sequence'></a> Install Ops Manager

Ops Manager, app runtimes, and associated products can run on multiple IaaSes.

Planning and installing Ops Manager and app runtimes means building layers from the bottom up,
starting with the details of your IaaS and progressing to configurations within the Ops Manager interface.


The following sections list how to prepare, install, and deploy Ops Manager by IaaS.
