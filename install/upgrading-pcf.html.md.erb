## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

The procedure below describes upgrading Pivotal Operations Manager, Pivotal Application Service (PAS), and product tiles.

The apps in your deployment continue to run during the upgrade. However, you cannot write to your deployment or make changes to apps during the upgrade.

For details about how upgrading impacts individual PAS components, see [What Happens During PAS Upgrades](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-7/operating/understanding-pas.html).

<%= vars.company_name %> recommends upgrading directly to Ops Manager v2.10 from Ops Manager v2.6. To upgrade Ops Manager to v2.10, see [Jump Upgrade to Ops Manager v2.10](#jump-upgrade) below. To upgrade both Ops Manager and PAS to v2.7 from v2.6, see [Task 1: Prepare to Upgrade](#prepare) below.


## <a id='jump-upgrade'></a> Jump Upgrade to Ops Manager v2.10

Jump upgrading describes the process of skipping minor versions when upgrading Ops Manager. Jump upgrading enables you to upgrade directly to the long-term support (LTS) version of Ops Manager, which is v2.10. Ops Manager v2.10 is supported through April 2024. For more information, see [Long-Term Support for Ops Manager v2.10](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-10/release-notes.html#lts) in _Ops Manager v2.10 Release Notes_.

To jump upgrade to Ops Manager v2.10:

1. Review the prerequisites and breaking changes described in [Jump Upgrading to Ops Manager v2.10](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-10/jump-upgrades.html).

1. Complete the steps to prepare Ops Manager, the BOSH Director, and BOSH-managed add-ons for upgrading in [Upgrade Preparation Checklist for Ops Manager v2.10](../upgrade/checklist.html). Do not complete the steps to prepare PAS for upgrading.

1. Follow the procedure in the v2.10 version of _Upgrading Ops Manager_ to upgrade Ops Manager, starting at [Task 1: Prepare to Upgrade](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-10/install/upgrading-pcf.html#prepare). Do not complete the steps to upgrade PAS.


## <a id='upgrade-tas'></a> Upgrade PAS

Although you can skip minor versions when upgrading Ops Manager, you should not skip minor versions when upgrading PAS. Skipping minor versions when upgrading PAS may result in additional breaking changes. To avoid this, upgrade PAS to v2.7.

To upgrade PAS to v2.7:

1. Complete the steps that are specific to PAS in [Upgrade Preparation Checklist for PAS v2.7](../upgrade/checklist.html).

1. See [Configuring PAS for Upgrades](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-7/operating/configuring.html) in the PAS documentation and [Upgrading PAS and Other Pivotal Platform Products](upgrading-products.html).

* [Check Diego State](#diego)
* [Take Snapshots of Storage Metrics](#storage)
* [Collect Logs](#collect-logs)

### <a id="status"></a> Check Status and Performance

You can monitor the progress of the upgrade by checking the status of the foundation at various locations.

Pivotal recommends live-monitoring your upgrade with Pivotal Healthwatch, which monitors and alerts on the current health, performance, and capacity of Ops Manager. Pivotal Healthwatch captures, calculates, stores, visualizes, and alerts on Ops Manager platform metrics, including:

* BOSH-reported VM metrics
* Runtime component metrics
* [Key Performance Indicators](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-7/overview//monitoring/kpi.html) and [Key Capacity Scaling Indicators](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-7/operating/monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html)
* Pivotal Healthwatch-generated [super metrics](https://docs.pivotal.io/healthwatch/metrics.html)

For more information, see the [Pivotal Healthwatch documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/healthwatch/index.html).

If you are not using Pivotal Healthwatch, you can do some or all of the following to monitor upgrade progress:

* Use the BOSH CLI to check the status of a task, VM, or instance. For more information, see [Check Status Using BOSH CLI](#bosh-cli-status) below.

* Check app availability.

* Run cf CLI commands.

* Check the availability of the Ops Manager UI.

* If using a network-attached storage (NAS) server, check the server's performance.

* If on vSphere, check vSphere performance.

#### <a id='bosh-cli-status'></a> Check Status Using BOSH CLI

To check the status of a task:

1. Run:

    ```
    bosh -e ALIAS task TASK-NUMBER
    ```
    Where:
    * `ALIAS` is your BOSH alias.
    * `TASK-NUMBER` is the number of the upgrade task you want to check.

To check the status of a VM:

1. Run:

    ```
    bosh -e ALIAS vms --vitals
    ```
    Where `ALIAS` is your BOSH alias.

To check the status of an instance:

1. Run:

    ```
    bosh -e ALIAS instances --ps
    ```
    Where `ALIAS` is your BOSH alias.

### <a id="diego"></a> Check Diego State

You can use the CF Diego Operator Toolkit (cfdot) to check Diego component instance count by current state. For more information, see the [cfdot](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cfdot) repository on GitHub.

### <a id="storage"></a> Take Snapshots of Storage Metrics

You can periodically take snapshots of storage metrics. Pivotal recommends this if you have a large foundation and have experienced storage issues in the past.

###  <a id="collect-logs"></a> Collect Logs

If you encounter problems during upgrade:

1. Collect the following information:
    * All job logs
    * Task debug logs for VM upgrade tasks
    * The installation log from Ops Manager

This information helps determine the cause of upgrade issues.


## <a id="after"></a> Task 4: After Upgrade

The following sections describe how to prepare for use of your new environment, check its health status, and clean up after upgrading your deployment:

* [Re-Create BOSH Alias](#bosh-alias)
* [Install New cf CLI](#cf-cli)
