This topic describes how to check and monitor current VM status in <%= vars.ops_manager_first %>.

For a complete guide to monitoring <%= vars.app_runtime_first %>, see [Monitoring <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/operating/monitoring/index.html).


## <a id='interface'></a> Monitoring VMs Using the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Interface

To view monitoring information:

1. Navigate to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click any product tile.

1. Select the **Status** tab.

The columns display the following information:

<table border="1" class="nice" >
<tr>
	<th>VM Data Point</th>
  <th>Details</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Job</strong></td>
  <td>Each job represents a component running on one or more VMs that <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Index</strong></td>
  <td>For jobs that run across multiple VMs, the <strong>index</strong> value indicates the order in which the job VMs were deployed. For jobs that run on only one VM, the VM has an <strong>index</strong> value of <code>0</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>IPs</strong></td>
  <td>IP address of the job VM.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>CID</strong></td>
  <td>Uniquely identifies the VM.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Load Avg15</strong></td>
  <td>CPU load average over 15 minutes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>CPU</strong></td>
  <td>Current CPU usage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Memory</strong></td>
  <td>Current memory usage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Swap</strong></td>
  <td>Swap file percentage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>System Disk</strong></td>
  <td>System disk space usage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Ephem. Disk</strong></td>
  <td>Ephemeral disk space usage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><strong>Pers. Disk</strong></td>
  <td>Persistent disk space usage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><strong>Logs</strong></td>
  <td>Download link for the most recent log files.</td>
</tr>
</table>

As of <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10.52, you can directly download logs for instances and instance groups from the **Status** page for a product tile.
The logs column for each instance group contains two links. The first link retrieves logs for the instance.
The second retrieves logs for the entire instance group. Clicking either link shows a loading icon as logs are queued for download.
When the logs are ready for download, the icon changes to a download link.

As in previous <%= vars.ops_manager %> versions, you can also download log files from the **Logs** tab.

![alt-text="The downloaded log links appear on the Status tab."](images/status-tab-direct-download.png)

### <a id='ops-manager'></a> <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM Disk Space

<%= vars.ops_manager %> stores its logs on the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM in the `/tmp` directory.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The logs collect over time and do not self-delete. To prevent the VM from running out of disk space, clear the log entries from <code>/tmp</code> by restarting the VM.</p>
