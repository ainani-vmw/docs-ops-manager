owner: Ops Manager
---

This topic describes how you can upgrade BOSH Director for <%= vars.ops_manager_first %> on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Perform these tasks as part of the <%= vars.ops_manager %> upgrade process.

For information about upgrading <%= vars.ops_manager %>, see [Task 2: Upgrade <%= vars.ops_manager %> and Installed Products to <%= vars.v_major_version %>](upgrading-pcf.html#upgrade_ops) in _Upgrading <%= vars.ops_manager %>.

<%= partial "./om_upgrade_overview" %>

To create an <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM instance:

1. Locate the <%= vars.ops_manager %> installation file. For more information, see [Locate the <%= vars.ops_manager %> installation file](#select-tgz).

1. Create a private VM image. For more information, see [Create a private VM image](#create-image).

1. Create the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM. For more information, see [Create the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM instance](#start-vm).

## <a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

<%= partial "./om_upgrade_prerequisite" %>

## <a id='select-tgz'></a> Locate the <%= vars.ops_manager %> installation file

The <%= vars.ops_manager %> installation file includes a filepath to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> image. You use this image file to create a private VM image for the new <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM.

To locate the <%= vars.ops_manager %> installation file:

1. Log in to [VMware Tanzu Network](https://tanzu.vmware.com/products) and click **<%= vars.ops_manager %>**.

1. From the **Releases** drop-down menu, select the release for your upgrade.

1. Select one of the following download files:
    * **<%= vars.ops_manager %> for GCP**
    * **<%= vars.ops_manager %> YAML for GCP**
    When you click the download link, your browser downloads or opens the <code>OpsManager\_<em>version</em>\_onGCP.pdf</code> or <code>OpsManager\_<em>version</em>\_onGCP.yml</code> file. <br/><br/>
    These documents provide the GCP location of the <%= vars.ops_manager %> `.tar.gz` installation file based on the geographic location of your installation.

1. Copy the filepath string of the <%= vars.ops_manager %> image based on your existing deployment location.

## <a id='create-image'></a> Create a private VM image

Create a private VM image to use when you create the new <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM.

To create a private VM image:

1. Log in to the [GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

1. In the navigation panel, click **Compute Engine** > **Images**.

1. Click **Create Image**.

1. Complete the following fields:

    * **Name:** Enter a name that matches the naming convention of your existing <%= vars.ops_manager %> image files.
    * **Encryption:** Leave **Automatic (recommended)** selected.
    * **Source:** Choose **Cloud Storage file**.
    * **Cloud Storage file:** Paste in the Google Cloud Storage filepath you copied from the PDF or YAML file in the previous task.

1. Click **Create**. The file might take a few minutes to import.

## <a id='start-vm'></a> Create the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM instance

Create an <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM instance to host the new version of <%= vars.ops_manager %>.

To create an <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM instance:

1. Select the check box for the image you previously created.

1. Click **Create Instance**.

2. In the **Create an instance form**, complete the following text boxes:

    * **Name:** Enter a name that matches the naming conventions of your existing deployment.
    * **Zone:** Select a zone from the region of your existing deployment.
    * **Machine type:** Click **Customize** to manually configure the vCPU and memory. An <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM instance requires the following minimum specifications:

        | **Machine Spec** | **Minimum Value** |
        |------------------|-------------------|
        |CPU               | 2&nbsp;vCPUs      |
        |Memory            | 8&nbsp;GB         |

    * **Boot disk:** Click **Change**, then perform the following steps:
        * Click **Custom images** if it is not already selected.
        * Click the **Boot disk type**. If you have an <%= vars.ops_manager %> environment with high performance needs, select **SSD**. As an example, environments used to develop <%= vars.ops_manager %> tiles may benefit from a higher performing <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM boot disk. For most environments, however, you can select **Standard**.
        * Set the **Size (GB)** of the boot disk to the minimum or higher.

            | **Machine Spec** | **Minimum Value** |
            |------------------|-------------------|
            |Boot disk         | 100&nbsp;GB       |

        * Click the <%= vars.ops_manager %> image you created in the previous step if it is not already selected.

        * Click **Select** to save.

    * In **Identity and API access**, click the **Service account** you created when you initially installed <%= vars.ops_manager %>. For more information, see [Step 1: Set up IAM Service Accounts](../gcp/prepare-env-manual.html#iam_account) in _Preparing to Deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %> on GCP_.
    * **Allow HTTP traffic:** Only select this check box if you selected it in your original <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM configuration.
    * **Allow HTTPS traffic:** Only select this check box if you selected it in your original <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM configuration.

    * **Networking:** Click the **Networking** tab and do the following:
        * For **Network** and **Subnetwork**, select the network and subnetwork you created when you initially deployed <%= vars.ops_manager %>. For more information, see [Step 3: Create a GCP Network with Subnets](../gcp/prepare-env-manual.html#create_network) in _Preparing to Deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %> on GCP_.
        * For **Network tags**, enter any tags that you applied to your original <%= vars.ops_manager %>. For example, if you used the `<%= vars.product_name_lc %>-opsmanager` tag to apply the firewall rule you created in [Step 5: Create Firewall Rules for the Network](../gcp/prepare-env-manual.html#firewall_rules) in _Preparing to Deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %> on GCP_, then apply the same tag to this <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM.
        * For **Internal IP**, click `Custom`. In the **Internal IP address** field, enter a spare address located within the reserved IP range you configured in your existing BOSH Director as part of [Step 5: Create Networks Page](../gcp/config-manual.html#network) in _Configuring BOSH Director on GCP_. Do not use `10.0.0.1`, which is configured for the Gateway.
        * For **External IP**, click **New static IP address...**. In the next form, enter a name for the static IP. For example, `om-public-ip`. Click **Reserve**. In the **External IP** drop-down menu, select the static IP address you just reserved.

3. Click **Create** to deploy the new <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM. This might take a few moments.

4. Go to your DNS provider, and modify the entry that points a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM. Replace the original <%= vars.ops_manager %> static IP address with the public IP address of the new <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM you created in a previous step.

<p class="note important">
<span class="note__title"> Important</span>
To set
up <%= vars.ops_manager %> authentication correctly, <%= vars.company_name %> recommends
using a FQDN to access <%= vars.ops_manager %>. Using an ephemeral IP address to
access <%= vars.ops_manager %> can cause authentication errors upon subsequent access. If
you are importing older <%= vars.ops_manager %> settings, you must use the FQDN.
</p>

## <a id='next'></a> Next steps

After you complete this procedure, continue the upgrade instructions in [Upgrading <%= vars.ops_manager %>](upgrading-pcf.html).

Later, if you need to SSH into the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM to perform diagnostic troubleshooting, see [Log in to <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM with SSH](ssh-login.html#ssh-by-iaas).
