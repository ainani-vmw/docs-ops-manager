## <a id='vsphere'></a> Monitoring in vSphere

To monitor VMs using the vSphere client:

1. Connect to a vCenter Server instance using the vSphere client.

1. Go to the **Hosts And Clusters** or **VMs And Templates** inventory view.

1. In the inventory tree, select a virtual machine.

1. Select the **Performance** tab.

VMware vSphere Server provides alarms that monitor VMs, as well as clusters, hosts, data centers, datastores, networks, and licensing.

To view pre-configured alarms, including disk usage alarms, related to a particular VM:

1. In the vSphere client, select the VM you want to monitor.

1. Click **Alarms**.

1. If a VM starts to run out of disk space, an alarm appears in the panel.
