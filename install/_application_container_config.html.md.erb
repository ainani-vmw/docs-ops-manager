In the **App Containers** pane, you enable microservice frameworks, private Docker registries, and other services that support your apps at the container level.

1. Select **App Containers**.

1. The **Enable custom buildpacks** checkbox governs the ability to pass a custom buildpack URL to the `-b` option of the `cf push` command. By default, this ability is enabled, letting developers use custom buildpacks when deploying apps. Disable this option by disabling the checkbox. For more information about custom buildpacks, see [Buildpacks](../buildpacks/).

1. The **Allow SSH access to app containers** checkbox controls SSH access to app instances. Enable the checkbox to permit SSH access across your deployment, and disable it to prevent all SSH access. For more information about SSH access permissions at the space and app scope, see [App SSH Overview](../devguide/deploy-apps/app-ssh-overview.html).
  <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> If you are using a load balancer instead of HAProxy, ensure that it has port 2222 open to enable SSH traffic. You can give SSH access to an app only if an admin assigns you a Space Developer role in the space where the app runs. For more information, see <a href="../console/console-roles.html#space-roles">Manage App Space Roles</a> in <em>Managing User Roles with Apps Manager</em>.</p>

1. If you want to enable SSH access for new apps by default in spaces that allow SSH, enable the **Enable SSH when an app is created** checkbox. If you disable this checkbox, developers can still enable SSH after pushing their apps by running `cf enable-ssh APP-NAME`.

1. Choose the method the Gorouter uses to verify app identity under **Router app identity verification**. To enable the Gorouter to verify app identity using TLS, click **Router uses TLS to verify app identity**. To enable the Gorouter and your apps to verify each other's identity using TLS, click **Router and apps use mutual TLS to verify each other's identity**.
  Verifying app identity using TLS or mutual TLS enables encryption between router and app containers and guards against misrouting during control plane failures. For more information about Gorouter route consistency modes, see [Preventing Misrouting](../concepts/http-routing.html#consistency) in _HTTP Routing_.
  <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> To support mutual TLS app identity verification, you need v2.3 or later of both PAS and Pivotal Isolation Segment (IST). The Gorouter and Diego Cell components in PAS v2.2 and earlier do not support mTLS handshakes.</p>
  <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> This feature does not work if the <strong>Disable SSL certificate verification for this environment</strong> checkbox is enabled in the <strong>Networking</strong> pane.</p>

1. You can configure PAS to run app instances in Docker containers by provided a comma-separated list of their IP address ranges in the **Private Docker insecure registry allow list** field. For more information, see [Using Docker Registries](../opsguide/docker-registry.html).

1. Select your preference for **Docker images disk cleanup scheduling on Diego Cell VMs**. If you choose **Clean up disk space once usage fills disk**, enter a value in MB for **Reserved disk space for other jobs**. This is the amount of space the garbage collection algorithm should keep free for other jobs. For more information about the configuration options and how to configure a reserved amount, see [Configuring Docker Images Disk Cleanup Scheduling](../opsguide/config-cell-cleanup.html).

1. The **Enable containerd delegation** checkbox governs whether or not Garden delegates container create and destroy operations to the containerd tool. By default, this option is enabled and Garden uses containerd. Disable this option by disabling the checkbox. For more information about the containerd tool, see [containerd](https://containerd.io).

1. Enter a number in the **Max-in-flight container starts** field. This number configures the maximum number of started instances across the Diego cells in your deployment. Entering `0` sets no limit. For more information, see [Setting a Maximum Number of Started Containers](../upgrading/configuring.html#container-starts).

1. Under **NFSv3 volume services**, select **Enable** or **Disable**. NFS volume services allow app developers to bind existing NFS volumes to their apps for shared file access. For more information, see [Enabling NFS Volume Services](../opsguide/enable-vol-services.html).
	<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> In a fresh install, NFSv3 volume services is enabled by default. In an upgrade, NFSv3 volume services is set to the same setting as it was in the previous deployment.</p>

1. (Optional) To configure LDAP for NFSv3 volume services:
  * For **LDAP service account user**, enter the username of the service account in LDAP that will manage volume services.
  * For **LDAP service account password**, enter the password for the service account.
  * For **LDAP server host**, enter the hostname or IP address of the LDAP server.
  * For **LDAP server port**, enter the LDAP server port number. If you do not specify a port number, Ops Manager uses 389.
  * For **LDAP user search base**, enter the location in the LDAP directory tree from which any LDAP user search begins. The typical LDAP search base matches your domain name. <br>For example, a domain named `cloud.example.com` typically uses the following LDAP user search base: `ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com`.
  * For **LDAP server CA certificate**, you can optionally enter a certificate if your LDAP server supports TLS and you want to enable TLS connections from the NFS driver to your LDAP server. Paste in the root certificate from your CA certificate or your self-signed certificate.
  <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> UAA can only parse one certificate entered into this field. If you enter multiple certificates, UAA only uses the first one you entered and ignores the rest. You only need to include one root certificate or self-signed certificate.</p>

1. (Optional) To enable SMB volume services, enable the **Enable SMB volume services** checkbox. Enabling SMB volume services allows developers to bind existing SMB shares to their apps. For more information, see [Enabling  Volume Services](../opsguide/enable-vol-services.html).
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you enable SMB volume services, you must set the <strong>SMB Broker Errand</strong> to <strong>On</strong> in the <strong>Errands</strong> pane.</p>

1. Select the **Format of timestamps in Diego logs**, either **RFC3339 timestamps** or **Seconds since the Unix epoch**.

1. (Optional) Modify the **Default health check timeout**. The value configured for this field is the amount of time allowed between starting up an app and the first healthy response from the app. If the health check does not receive a healthy response within the configured timeout, then the app is declared unhealthy. The default timeout is `60` seconds and the maximum configurable timeout is `600` seconds.

1. Click **Save**.
