When you deploy <%= vars.ops_manager_first %> to Azure, you provision a set of resources. This topic describes how to delete the resources associated with an <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment.

The fastest way to remove resources is to delete the resource group, or resource groups, associated with your <%= vars.ops_manager %> on Azure installation.


## Delete the Resource Group

To delete a resource group:

1. Navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Within your subscription, select **Resource Groups**.

1. Click on the resource group you wish to delete.

1. In the details pane for the resource group, click on the trash can icon. Review the information in the confirmation screen before proceeding.

1. To confirm deletion, type in the resource group name and click **Delete**.

For more information about managing resource groups in Azure, see the [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-portal).
