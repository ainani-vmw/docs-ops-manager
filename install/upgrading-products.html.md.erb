This topic describes how to upgrade to a point release of Pivotal Application Service
(PAS) and other product tiles without upgrading Ops Manager.
For example, use this topic to upgrade from PAS v2.7.0
to v2.7.1. You might need to perform this upgrade if a security update
for PAS is released, or if new features are introduced in a point
release of a product tile.

For PAS component and version information, see [Pivotal Application Service
v2.7 Release Notes](http://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/release-notes/runtime-rn.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you cannot download products from <%= vars.product_network %>
  due to restricted network connectivity, see <a href="offline_installation.html">Installing
  Ops Manager in Air-Gapped Environments</a>.</p>


## <a id="before-upgrade"></a> Prerequisites

Before you upgrade to point releases:

* You must have completed the procedure in [Upgrading Ops Manager](upgrading-pcf.html).

* For the latest compatibility information, see [Upgrade Planner](https://upgrade-planner.pivotal.io/) before upgrading PAS.

* **Important:** Read the _Known Issues_ sections for the products that you plan to install
before starting. For all available product release notes, see:
  * [Ops Manager v2.7 Release Notes](../release-notes.html) in the Ops Manager
  documentation
  * [Pivotal Application Service v2.7 Release Notes](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/release-notes/runtime-rn.html)
  in the PAS documentation
  * [Pivotal Isolation Segment v2.7 Release Notes](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/release-notes/segment-rn.html)
  in the PAS documentation
  * [Pivotal Application Service for Windows v2.7 Release Notes](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-7/windows/release-notes.html)
  in the Pivotal Application Service for Windows (PASW) documentation
  * [Release Notes](https://docs.pivotal.io/tkgi/release-notes.html) in the VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition
  (TKGI) documentation

## <a id="upgrade-er"></a> Upgrading PAS

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you are using the <%= vars.product_network %> API,
  the latest product versions automatically appear in the Ops Manager Installation
  Dashboard. For more information, see <a href="add-delete.html#pivnet-api">Using
  <%= vars.product_network %> API to Upgrade Products</a> in <em>Adding and Deleting Products</em>.</p>

To upgrade PAS without upgrading Ops Manager:

1. Download the product file from [<%= vars.product_network %>](https://network.pivotal.io/).

1. Import the product file to your Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the **+** icon next to the uploaded product description to add this product to your
staging area.

1. Click the newly added tile to review any configurable options.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.

1. Click **Apply Changes** to install the service.


## <a id="other-products"></a> Upgrading Ops Manager Products

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you are using the <%= vars.product_network %> API,
  the latest product versions automatically appear in the Ops Manager Installation
  Dashboard. For more information, see <a href="add-delete.html#pivnet-api">Using
  <%= vars.product_network %> API to Upgrade Products</a> in <em>Adding and Deleting Products</em>.</p>

This section describes how to upgrade individual products like [Single Sign-On for VMware Tanzu Application Service](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-identity/index.html), [VMware Tanzu SQL with MySQL for VMs](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/index.html), [VMware Tanzu RabbitMQ for VMs](https://docs.pivotal.io/rabbitmq-cf/index.html), and [App Metrics](https://docs.pivotal.io/app-metrics/index.html) in your
deployment. Ensure you review the individual product upgrade procedure for each tile.

To upgrade your products:

1. Browse to [<%= vars.product_network %>](https://network.pivotal.io/) and sign in.

1. Download the latest release for the product or products that you want to upgrade. Every
product is tied to exactly one stemcell. Download the stemcell that matches your product and
version.

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Import a Product**.

1. Select the `.pivotal` file that you downloaded from <%= vars.product_network %> or received
from your software distributor, then click **Open**. If the product is successfully added,
it appears in your product list. If the product that you selected is not the latest version,
the most up-to-date version appears in your product list.

1. Click the **+** icon next to the product description to add the product tile to the
Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Repeat the import, upload, and upgrade steps for each product you downloaded.

1. If you are upgrading a product that uses a self-signed certificate from v1.1 to v1.2, you
must configure the product to trust the self-signed certificate. To configure a product to
trust the self-signed certificate:
    1. Click the product tile.
    1. In the left-hand column, select the setting page containing the SSL certificate configuration.
    For example, for PAS, select the **HAProxy** pane.
    1. Check the **Trust Self-Signed Certificates** box.
    1. Click **Save**.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.

1. Click **Apply Changes**.


## <a id="replica-tiles"></a> Upgrading Replicated Tiles

To upgrade a replicated tile, you must:

* Generate a replica of the newer version of the tile using the Replicator
* Give the new replica the same name as the existing replica.

### <a id="replica-example"></a> Example Workflow

This example workflow assumes the following:

* You used the Replicator to generate a replica of the Pivotal Isolation Segment v1
tile.
* You used the `name` **seg-one**.
* You installed the tile in Ops Manager.
* You used the following sample Replicator command for the initial installation:

    ```mac
    ./replicator-darwin\
    --name seg-one\
    --path /download/p-isolation-segment-v1.pivotal\
    --output /output/p-isolation-segment-v1-seg-one.pivotal
    ```

To upgrade your replicated tile to Pivotal Isolation Segment v2:

1. Download and unzip the new Replicator from the [Pivotal Isolation Segment]
(https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-isolation-segment/) page on <%= vars.product_network %>.
You must download the version of Replicator that corresponds with the version of the
Pivotal Isolation Segment tile you want to replicate.

1. Create the replica by running:

    ```mac
      ./replicator-darwin\
      --name NAME-OF-EXISTING-REPLICA \
      --path PATH-TO-NEW-TILE \
      --output /output/p-isolation-segment-v2-seg-one.pivotal
    ```
    Where:
    * `NAME-OF-EXISTING-REPLICA` must be the same as the name used for the existing replica.
    In this example, this name is **seg-one**.
    * `PATH-TO-NEW-TILE` is the path to the new Pivotal Isolation Segment tile.

1. After you create the replica tile **p-isolation-segment-v2-seg-one.pivotal**, upload it
to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard. This upgrades the Pivotal Isolation Segment
v1 replica tile in place.
