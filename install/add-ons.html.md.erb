This documentation explains how to deploy optional BOSH Add-ons as a part of installing Ops Manager.

##<a id='overview'></a>Overview

BOSH Add-ons are optional platform extensions that you deploy with BOSH rather than installing them as Pivotal Operations Manager tiles.

Pivotal recommends installing BOSH Add-ons immediately after deploying BOSH and Ops Manager, before you use Ops Manager to add tiles to the platform.

BOSH Add-ons from Pivotal include [IPsec](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-ipsec), [ClamAV](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-antivirus), and [File Integrity Monitoring](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-fim), which enhance Ops Manager security and security logging.

[Open-source BOSH Add-ons](https://bosh.io/docs/addons-common.html) include a syslog forwarder, a custom SSH login banner, and a tool for adding SSH users.

See [Deploying Software with BOSH](./deploy-bosh-om.html#bosh) for an overview of the BOSH deployment process.
