title: Expanding your network with additional subnets
owner: Ops Manager

You can add more than one subnet to each network using the BOSH Director.

After you deploy <%= vars.ops_manager_first %>, you can expand your network with multiple, overlapping availability zones (AZs). You might want to create subnets with overlapping AZs if your current subnet is full and you determine that your network needs expansion.

![The Add Subnet button is next to the Subnets label in the Create Network pane of <%= vars.ops_manager %>.](images/gcp/add-subnet.png)
