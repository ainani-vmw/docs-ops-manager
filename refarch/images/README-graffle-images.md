# Reference architecture Omnigraffle images notes

The .graffle illustration files in this /images directory were created with the [Omnigraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle/) diagram illustration tool. They are source files for the .png images included in the PCF Reference Architecture docs, for example https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/refarch-aws-aws_ref_arch.html.

To convert the illustrations into .png image files from Omnigraffle: **File** menu > **Export...** and select **Format: PNG bitmap image**.

The PCF 2 NSX-T Ref Arch v1.1.graffle file contains two illustrations in different canvases: **PCF 2.x PAS PKS No-NSX-T** and **PCF 2.x PAS PKS NSX-T**.  Two diagrams in one!
