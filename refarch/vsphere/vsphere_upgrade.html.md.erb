title: Upgrading vSphere without causing downtime for your runtime
owner: Customer0
---

You can upgrade the vSphere components that host your runtime deployment, either <%= vars.app_runtime_first %> or <%= vars.k8s_runtime_first %>, without disrupting service.

## <a id='overview'></a> Minimum requirements

At minimum, vSphere contains a vCenter Server and one or more ESXi hosts.

You cannot complete an in-place upgrade of vSphere without at least two ESXi hosts in your cluster.

If you do not meet this requirement, you have insufficient resources to evacuate an entire
host, and you will experience runtime downtime during the upgrade.

To upgrade vSphere with only one ESXi host, or without sufficient headroom capacity, you must
reduce your runtime deployment size. To do this, you can:

* Reduce the number of Diego Cells in your deployment
* Pause VMs to make more capacity available.

These actions might result in downtime for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> or <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>.


## <a id='rec_start'></a> Recommended starting configuration

If you run a <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> or <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> deployment
following the base reference architecture described in [vSphere reference architecture](vsphere_ref_arch.html),
your vSphere deployment has these components:

* One vCenter Server

* Three ESXi hosts per cluster

* Three or more clusters

* One NSX Edge appliance (or an HA pair)

<%= vars.company_name %> recommends having at least
three ESXi hosts in your cluster to maintain high availability (HA) during your upgrade.


## <a id='upgrade_procedure'></a> Upgrade vSphere

The following sections describe the procedure to upgrade the vSphere management layer that underlies <%= vars.ops_manager %>.

### <a id='upgrade_vcenter'></a> Step 1: Upgrade vCenter

To upgrade vCenter, see the instructions in [Overview of the vCenter server upgrade
process](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vcenter.upgrade.doc/GUID-C5CBFB63-4E95-4143-BA89-89AA5D292C68.html) in the
vSphere documentation.

### <a id='upgrade_esxi'></a> Step 2: Upgrade ESXi hosts

After a successful vCenter upgrade, you must upgrade your ESXi hosts one at a time, starting
with the first ESXi host.

To upgrade your ESXi hosts:

1. Verify that your ESXi hosts have sufficient resources and headroom to evacuate the VM workload
of a single ESXi host to the two remaining hosts.

    If you have enabled vSphere HA on your ESXi host, ensure that
    each ESXi host has sufficient headroom capacity; vSphere HA reserves 66% of available memory.

1. Use vMotion to move all the VMs on the host you want to upgrade to the other ESXi hosts.
vMotion places the VMs on the other hosts based on available capacity. For more information,
see [Migration with vMotion](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.vcenterhost.doc/GUID-D19EA1CB-5222-49F9-A002-4F8692B92D63.html) in the vSphere documentation.

1. Upgrade the evacuated ESXi host. See [Upgrading ESXi hosts](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.esxi.upgrade.doc/GUID-122035F6-8433-463E-A0F7-B4FC71A05B04.html) in the vSphere
documentation.

1. Repeat the previous steps for each remaining host, one at a time. vSphere automatically
rebalances all VMs back onto the upgraded hosts through DRS after you have upgraded all hosts.

### <a id="upgrade_nsx"></a> Step 3: Upgrade ESG on VMware NSX

If your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment is on a network behind an Edge Services Gateway
(ESG) as recommended in [vSphere Reference Architecture](vsphere_ref_arch.html), upgrade each
ESG only after completing the upgrade of vCenter and your ESXi hosts.

When you upgrade an ESG on VMware NSX, you upgrade the NSX Manager software. This upgrade can
cause some slight downtime, the amount of which depends on the number of ESGs you are using:

* If your deployment only has one ESG, you can expect a downtime of five minutes for network
re-convergence.

* If your ESGs are deployed in HA, upgrade the first ESG. Then, upgrade the second ESG. This
upgrade causes only 15-20 seconds of downtime.

For more information, see [NSX Upgrade Guide](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-Data-Center-for-vSphere/6.4/com.vmware.nsx.upgrade.doc/GUID-4613AC10-BC73-4404-AF80-26E924EF5FE0.html) in the VMware
documentation.
