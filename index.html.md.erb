This topic introduces <%= vars.ops_manager_first %> (previously Pivotal <%= vars.ops_manager %> or PCF <%= vars.ops_manager %>) and describes how you can get started.

## <a id='overview'></a> About <%= vars.ops_manager %>

<%= vars.ops_manager %> is a software tool to help you expand and manage products you can install on your deployment. Each of these products is represented as a _tile_ in the UI.

<%= vars.ops_manager %> deploys with the BOSH Director tile by default, which is a single point of control for VMs. The BOSH Director supports various IaaSes, including AWS, Azure, GCP, OpenStack, and vSphere.

With <%= vars.ops_manager %>, you can install two types of tiles:

* **Runtime Tiles:** You can install VM-based or Kubernetes-based runtimes. These dynamically run apps and other processes to balance demand throughout app lifecycles. Example runtimes managed though <%= vars.ops_manager %> include <%= vars.app_runtime_first %> and <%= vars.k8s_runtime_first %>.

* **Service Tiles:** You can install various services that help support your deployment. Example services you can manage through <%= vars.ops_manager %> include MySQL, Redis, and Gemfire.

For more information about the tiles you can install,
see [<%= vars.product_network %>](https://network.pivotal.io/).
