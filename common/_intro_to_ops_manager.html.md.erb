The <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard is the dashboard for administering the runtimes and services within your deployment.

The BOSH Director, deployed as part of the <%= vars.ops_manager %> installation, controls VM creation and deployment,
as well as other software and service lifecycle events. <%= vars.ops_manager %> includes the BOSH Director tile used to configure BOSH Director.

Example runtimes and services managed though <%= vars.ops_manager %> include, but are not limited to, <%= vars.app_runtime_first %> and <%= vars.k8s_runtime_first %>.
