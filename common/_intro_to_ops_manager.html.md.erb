The Ops Manager Installation Dashboard is the dashboard for administering the runtimes and services within your deployment.

The BOSH Director, deployed as part of the Ops Manager installation, controls VM creation and deployment,
as well as other software and service lifecycle events. Ops Manager includes the BOSH Director tile used to configure BOSH Director.

Example runtimes and services managed though Ops Manager include, but are not limited to, Pivotal Application Service (PAS) and VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition (TKGI).
