Do the following steps to log in to the BOSH Director VM with SSH:

1. From <%= vars.ops_manager %>, open the BOSH Director tile.

1. Click the **Credentials** tab.

1. Next to **Bbr Ssh Credentials**, click **Link to Credential**. A tab opens containing a JSON
credential structure.

1. Copy the `RSA PRIVATE KEY` and paste it into a file named `bbr.pem`. Include
`-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`.

    <p> Keep the key secure. The key provides full
    access to the entire <%= vars.ops_manager %> environment.</p>

1. Replace all `\n` characters in `bbr.pem` with a line break.

1. Copy `bbr.pem` to the `~/.ssh/` directory on your computer.

1. Run `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/bbr.pem` to modify the permissions of the file.

1. Log in to the BOSH Director VM with SSH from your machine.

    ```
    ssh bbr@BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP -i ~/.ssh/bbr.pem
    ```

    <p> If you use GCP, ensure SSH port <code>22</code> is open
    for the BOSH Director VM in your GCP console. If the SSH port is not open, open it by creating
    a firewall rule.</p>

1. Run `sudo -i` to get the root privilege.
