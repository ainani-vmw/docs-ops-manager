Ops Manager requires that the NSX firewall routes are not blocked. All communication between Ops Manager VMs and vCenter or ESXi hosts route
through the NSX firewall and are blocked by default. 
For more information on which ports to allow, see <a href="https://ports.vmware.com/home/vSphere" target="_blank">VMware Ports and Protocols</a> for vSphere.
