This topic describes how to use Pivotal Operations Manager to configure the BOSH Director on Azure Germany.

First, you must complete the steps in [Preparing to Deploy Ops Manager on Azure](./prepare-env-manual.html) and [Deploying Ops Manager on Azure](./deploy-manual.html).

Then, in the BOSH Director tile, select **Azure German Cloud** from the **Azure Environment** dropdown.

For more information about configuring Azure, see [Azure Config Page](config-manual.html#azure-config) in _Configuring BOSH Director on Azure_.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Azure Germany is only supported in Ops Manager (formerly Pivotal Cloud Foundry) v1.10.1 and later.</p>
