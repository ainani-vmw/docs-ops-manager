This topic describes how to configure the BOSH Director tile within Pivotal Operations Manager on Azure after [Deploying Ops Manager to Azure](./prepare-env-terraform.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can also perform the procedures in this topic using the Ops Manager API. For more information, see <a href="../install/ops-man-api.html">Using the Ops Manager API</a>.</p>


## <a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisite

To complete the procedures in this topic, you must have access to the output generated when you ran `terraform apply` to create resources for this deployment. To view this output, run `terraform output` in the directory where you ran `terraform apply`. You use tidhe values in this output to configure the BOSH Director tile.


## <a id='access-om'></a> Step 1: Log Into <%= vars.ops_manager %>

1. In a web browser, navigate to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of Ops Manager. Use the `ops_manager_dns` value from running `terraform output`.

1. Log into <%= vars.ops_manager %>. To log in, see [Log In to <%= vars.ops_manager %> For the First Time](../login.html#login-first-time).

## <a id='azure-config'></a> Step 2: Azure Config Page

1. Click the **BOSH Director** tile.

1. Select **Azure Config**.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/azure/azure-config.png", :alt => "At the top of the image is the header 'BOSH Director for Azure', below which are three tabs in a horizontal row labeled 'Settings', 'Status', and 'Credentials'. The Settings tab is highlighted in light gray to show that it is selected, while the others are dark gray. Below the Settings tab is a list of panes on the left labeled, from top to bottom: 'Azure Config', 'Director Config', 'Create Networks', 'Assign AZs and Networks', 'Security', 'BOSH DNS Config', 'Syslog', and 'Resource Config'. Each pane has a green circle with a checkmark inside to the left of its label. Azure Config is highlighted in dark gray to show that it is selected. To the right of the image is the header 'Azure Config', below which are text fields labeled, from top to bottom: 'Subscription ID', 'Tenant ID', 'Application ID', 'Client Secret', 'Resource Group Name', and 'BOSH Storage Account Name'. All of these fields are marked with red asterisks to denote that they are mandatory fields. The 'Client Secret' field contains eight asterisks, while the word 'Change' in blue letters is underneath the text field. Below 'BOSH Storage Account Name' are the words 'Cloud Storage Type' with two options underneath: a selected radio button labeled 'Use Managed Disks', below which is a dropdown labeled 'Storage Account Type' with 'Premium_LRS' selected; and a radio button labeled 'Use Storage Accounts', below which is a grayed-out text field labeled 'Deployments Storage Account Name'. Below this are more text fields, labeled 'Default Security Group' and 'SSH Public Key', the latter of which has a red asterisk. Next is a text area labeled 'SSH Private Key' with a red asterisk.

Under 'Persistent Disk Type' is one dropdown with 'Automatic: 50 GB' selected for BOSH Director and the word 'None' for Master Compilation Job.") %>

1. Adjust any values as necessary for your deployment. Under the **Instances**, **VM Type**, and **Persistent Disk Type** fields, choose **Automatic** from the dropdown to allocate the recommended resources for the job. If the **Persistent Disk Type** field reads **None**, the job does not require persistent disk space.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For the BOSH Director job, select a VM type with at least 8&nbsp;GB memory.</p>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you set a field to <strong>Automatic</strong> and the recommended resource allocation changes in a future version, Ops Manager automatically uses the new recommended allocation.</p>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you install <%= vars.windows_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %>),
    provision your <strong>Master Compilation Job</strong> with at least 100&nbsp;GB of disk space.</p>

1. (Optional) To add a load balancer to the BOSH Director, select the icon next to the **BOSH Director** job name to see the **Load Balancers** field and **Internet Connected** checkbox.
For **Load Balancers**, enter your Azure application gateway name under the **BOSH Director** job.
To create an application gateway, follow the procedures in [Create an application gateway with SSL termination using Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-ssl-arm) from the Azure documentation. When you create the application gateway, associate the gateway's IP with your system domain.

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='complete'></a> Step 11: Complete the BOSH Director Installation

1. Click the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes**. If the following ICMP error message appears, click **Ignore errors and start the install**.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/cloudform/install-error.png", :alt => "At the top of the image is the rectangular, dark green Ops Manager page header, with a teal square containing a capital P on the far left, the words 'Pivotal Ops Manager' to the right of the square, and the words 'pivotal-cf' beside a downward-pointing carat on the far right. Below the header is an error message with a red background. To the left on the error message is a red triangle containing an exclamation point beside the words 'Please review the errors below'. Below 'Please review the errors below' is a bullet list with two items: 'Cannot reach gateway with IP 10.0.16.1 (ignorable if ICMP is disabled)' and 'Cannot reach DNS with IP 10.0.0.2 (ignorable if ICMP is disabled)'. To the right of this list are two buttons: a white, rectangular button labeled 'Ignore errors and start the install' in red letters on the left, and a red, rectangular button labeled 'Stop and fix errors' in white letters on the right.") %>

1. BOSH Director installs. This may take a few moments. When the installation process successfully completes, the **Changes Applied** window appears.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/cloudform/ops-manager-complete.png", :alt => "A pop-up window with a round, gray X button in the upper-right corner and the words 'Changed Applied' next to a round, green circle containing a checkmark. Below 'Changed Applied' are the words 'Ops Manager Director was successfully installed. We recommend that you export a backup of this installation from the actions menu.' Below this text and to the right of the pop-up window are a gray, rectangular button labeled 'Close' next to a blue, rectangular button labeled 'Return to Installation Dashboard'.") %>
