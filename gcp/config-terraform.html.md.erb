<%= partial "/pcf/warning-terraform" %>

This topic describes how to configure the BOSH Director for Ops Manager on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) after [Preparing to Deploy Ops Manager on GCP Using Terraform](./prepare-env-terraform.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can also perform the procedures in this topic using the Pivotal Operations Manager API. For more information, see the <a href="../install/ops-man-api.html">Using the Ops Manager API</a> topic.</p>


## <a id='prereq'></a> Prerequisite

To complete the procedures in this topic, you must have access to the output from when you ran `terraform apply` to create resources for this deployment. You can view this output at any time by running `terraform output`. You use the values in your Terraform output to configure the BOSH Director tile.


## <a id='access-om'></a> Step 1: Log Into Ops Manager

1. In a web browser, navigate to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of Ops Manager. Use the `ops_manager_dns` value from running `terraform output`.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> In order to set up Ops Manager authentication correctly, Pivotal recommends using a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) to access Ops Manager. Using an ephemeral IP address to access Ops Manager can cause authentication errors upon subsequent access.</p>

1. Log into Ops Manager. To log in, see [Log In to Ops Manager For the First Time](../login.html#login-first-time).

## <a id='gcp-config'></a> Step 2: Google Cloud Platform Config

1. Click the **Google Cloud Platform** tile within the **Installation Dashboard**.

1. Select **Google Config**. Complete the following fields:
    * **Project ID**: Enter the value of `project` from your `terraform.tfvars` file.
    * **Default Deployment Tag**: Enter the value of `env_name` from your `terraform.tfvars` file.
    * Select **AuthJSON** and in the field below enter the contents of the JSON file for you service account key.
        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> As an alternative, you can select <strong>The Ops Manager VM Service Account</strong> option to use the service account automatically created by GCP for the Ops Manager VM.</p>
       <%= image_tag("../common/images/gcp/google_config.png", :alt => "At the top of the image is the header 'Google Cloud Platform Config', underneath which is a horizonal line. Below the line are two text fields: one labeled 'Project ID' with a red asterisk to denote that it is a required field, and another labeled 'Default Deployment Tag'. Below this are two options: one selected radio button labeled 'The Ops Manager VM Service Account', and another button labeled 'AuthJSON'. Underneath 'AuthJSON' is a blank text area. At the bottom of the image is a blue, rectangular button labeled 'Save'.") %>

1. Click **Save**.

<%= partial "../common/director-config" %>


## <a id='az'></a> Step 4: Create Availability Zones Page

  <div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Pivotal recommends at least three availability zones for a highly available installation.
    <ul>
      <li>For configuring a PAS deployment with multiple availability zones, see <a href="../refarch/gcp/gcp_ref_arch.html">Reference Architecture for Ops Manager on GCP</a>.</li>
      <li>For TKGI best practices for distributing workloads across multiple availability zones and clusters, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pks/maintain-uptime.html">Maintaining Workload Uptime</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

1. Select **Create Availability Zones**.

1. Use the **Add** button to add three availability zones corresponding to those listed in the `azs` field in your Terraform output.

1. Click **Save**.


## <a id='network'></a> Step 5: Create Networks Page

1. Select **Create Networks**.

1. Make sure **Enable ICMP checks** is not selected. GCP routers do not respond to ICMP pings.

1. Use the **Add Network** button to create the following three networks:
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To use a shared VPC network, enter the shared VPC host project name before the network name in the format <code>VPC-PROJECT-NAME/NETWORK-NAME/SUBNET-NAME/REGION-NAME</code>. For example, <code>vpc-project/opsmgr/central/us-central1</code>. For more information, see <a href="../install/gcp-shared-vpc.html">Configuring a Shared VPC on GCP</a>.</p>

## <a id="assign-azs"></a> Step 6: Assign AZs and Networks Page

1. Select **Assign AZs and Networks**.

1. Use the dropdown to select a **Singleton Availability Zone**. The BOSH Director installs in this Availability Zone.

1. Under **Network**, select the `infrastructure` network for your BOSH Director.

1. Click **Save**.


## <a id='security'></a> Step 7: Security Page

<%= partial "../common/security-pane" %>

## <a id='syslog'></a> Step 8: Syslog Page

<%= partial(:"/pcf/ops-manager/syslog_bosh", :locals => { :syslog_context => 'BOSH Director' }) %>

## <a id='resource-config'></a> Step 9: Resource Config Page

1. Select **Resource Config**.
    <%= image_tag("../common/images/gcp/om_resource_config.png", :alt => "At the top of the image is the header 'Resource Config'. In the top right corner of the image is a blue, rectangular button labeled 'Save'. Below the header are four columns labeled, from left to right, 'Job', 'Instances', 'VM Type', and 'Persistent Disk Type'. Under 'Job' are rows labeled with the names of two VMs, 'BOSH Director' and 'Master Compilation Job'. The 'Master Compilation Job' row is expanded, which reveals a 'Load Balancers' field and an 'Internet Connected' checkbox. The 'Load Balancers' field is blank and the 'Internet Connected' checkbox is selected. Under 'Instances' are two dropdowns, with 'Automatic: 1' for BOSH Director and '1' for Master Compilation Job selected. Under 'VM Type' are two dropdowns, with 'Automatic: large.disk (cpu: 2...' selected for BOSH Director and 'small (cpu: 1, ram: 2 GB, disk...' selected for Master Compilation Job. Under 'Persistent Disk Type' is one dropdown with 'Automatic: 50 GB' selected for BOSH Director and the word 'None' for Master Compilation Job.") %>

1. To add a load balancer to the BOSH Director, select the icon next to the **BOSH Director** job name to see the **Load Balancers** field and **Internet Connected** checkbox. Ensure that the **Internet Connected** checkbox is not selected for any job. The Terraform templates do not provision a Network Address Translation (NAT) box for internet connectivity to your VMs, so instead VMs are provided with ephemeral public IP addresses to allow the jobs to reach the internet.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you want to provision a Network Address Translation (NAT) box to provide internet connectivity to your VMs instead of providing them with public IP addresses, deselect the <strong>Internet Connected</strong> checkboxes. For more information about using NAT in GCP, see the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/networking">GCP documentation</a>.</p>
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you install Pivotal Application Service for Windows (PASW), provision your <strong>Master Compilation Job</strong> with at least 100&nbsp;GB of disk space.</p>

## <a id='custom-vm-extensions'></a> Step 10: (Optional) Add Custom VM Extensions

<%= partial '../common/vm-extension-config'  %>

## <a id='complete'></a> Step 11: Complete the BOSH Director Installation

1. Click the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes**. If the following ICMP error message appears, return to the [Network Config](#network) screen, and make sure you have deselected the **Enable ICMP Checks** box. Click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes** again.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/cloudform/install-error.png", :alt => "At the top of the image is the rectangular, dark green Ops Manager header, with a teal square containing a capital P on the far left, the words 'Pivotal Ops Manager' to the right of the square, and the words 'pivotal-cf' beside a downward-pointing carat on the far right. Below the header is an error message with a red background. To the left on the error message is a red triangle containing an exclamation point beside the words 'Please review the errors below'. Below 'Please review the errors below' is a bullet list with two items: 'Cannot reach gateway with IP 10.0.16.1 (ignorable if ICMP is disabled)' and 'Cannot reach DNS with IP 10.0.0.2 (ignorable if ICMP is disabled)'. To the right of this list are two buttons: a white, rectangular button labeled 'Ignore errors and start the install' in red letters on the left, and a red, rectangular button labeled 'Stop and fix errors' in white letters on the right.") %>

1. BOSH Director installs. This may take a few moments. When the installation process successfully completes, the **Changes Applied** window appears.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/cloudform/ops-manager-complete.png", :alt => "A pop-up window with a round, gray X button in the upper-right corner and the words 'Changed Applied' next to a round, green circle containing a checkmark. Below 'Changed Applied' are the words 'Ops Manager Director was successfully installed. We recommend that you export a backup of this installation from the actions menu.' Below this text and to the right of the pop-up window are a gray, rectangular button labeled 'Close' next to a blue, rectangular button labeled 'Return to Installation Dashboard'.") %>
